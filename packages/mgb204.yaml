    This package contains a number of textures and HD rendered props for making Tennis scenes in the Lot Editor\*.


    There are textures and props to make tennis courts in Straight, Diagonal and Fractionally Angled (22.5° & -22.5°) rotations. Additionally there are props for Tennis Nets, Court Fencing and a few
    extras that may come in handy when lotting. Prop families have also been used for the Court and Fencing props, which will randomly select one of the available colours/styles.


    It should be noted that this is a Dependency, as such you will not find any new lots as a result of installing this file.


    Huge thanks to KingOfSimCity for providing the inspiration for this pack and the included textures. Also for collaborating with me on the props development.

    This package contains a small convenience store, with three model variations in a buildings family, along with lots to use them. Inside the "Models" folder, please ensure you remove 3 files you
    will not need. Included are models for the following options:


    - HD (High Definition/Better Quality textures)

    - SD (Default texture quality)

    - DN (DarkNite, for users of SimFox's DarkNite mod)

    - MN (MaxisNite, for default lighting)


    So for example, if you are using HD-MN, you should remove the files ending HD-DN, SD-DN and SD-MN, leaving only your preferred choice behind.


    Using my Retail Signage Pack dependency, these stores will show randomly one of the installed Banner/Logo options.


    3 Lots are included:


    - Stage 2 CS$$ 3x2

    - Stage 2 CS$$ 3x3 (Right Corner)

    - Stage 1 CS$$ 4x4.

  authors:
    - MGB204
  category: 120
  description: >-
    This package contains modular rail depot models, rail service platforms plus props (linked to automata) and textures to use with them.


    Whilst the idea of this package is to allow lotters to use them making Rail Depots, there are a number of user-customisable features, that any lots created with this resource can take advantage
    of.


    ***The main depot props have been rendered in three different ways. Two HD versions, containing higher-res textures, with either Maxis Nite or Dark Nite variants. There is also an SD Maxis Nite
    version for those who dislike/can't use HD models.***


    The textures included can be customised during installation to support many different configurations. The automata props are linked to the installed automata for Rail, HSR/Monorail and
    GLR/EL-Rail. This means lots using them will show a users installed automata on them (limitations apply). The Depot and Automata props are provided additionally in three timed groups, for more
    variation.

    This package contains props which show banners with retail logos.


    The basic idea is that the props are in a family. That way when the family is used on a lot, one will be randomly selected from the installed props.


    Currently I'm really just testing out the concept. But to get things going, I've made almost 30 banners/props, grouped by 6 countries:


    - AUS - Australia

    - DE - Germany

    - JPN - Japan

    - RUS - Russia

    - UK - United Kingdom

    - US - United States


    Each pack contains between 3 and 6 props, for stores of those countries. Here's the neat part...


    You can choose to install only one region, selected regions or even all of them, it's totally up to you. But whichever you install will dictate which stores appear on lots using the props. For now
    these will support my Convenience Store lots, watch out for those in the coming days. But perhaps there is room to expand on the concept in future.


    One last bonus. I've included some basic resources, 3D Modelling application files, sample texture. Readme for anyone who wants to have a go making their own compatible props. There are two files,
    one .max for 3DS Max users (made with 2011). Along with .3DS which can be imported into SC4BAT, see the included documentation for more info.

    The MGB Texture Pack is intended for lotters and includes a number of useful textures. Of course this file will be a necessary dependency for any lots made using the included resources. Please
    note, there is no content that you will find in-game from installing this download stand-alone.


    **INFO FOR USERS**


    **OPTIONAL OVERRIDES:**


    Optional overrides should be installed in the same folder as the main package, where used. The following options are available:


    - *zMGB Texture Pack_RVT TSR Stret Override - For users of Rivit's TSR Street Mod.*

    - *zMGB Texture Pack_SAM5 RVT Override - For users of Rivit's SAM5 Rural TSR Mod*

    - *zMGB Texture Pack_SAM6 DK Override - For users of my SAM6 Darkened Mod*

    - *zMGB Texture Pack_SAM7 BP Override - For users of my SAM7 Bikepaths Mod*

    - *zMGB Texture Pack_SAM10 SD Override*


    ***Default SAM10 Textures use HD (256x256px) resolution. The LE (Maxis) can not show these textures. But there should be no problems in-game with them.&nbsp;However, those who prefer SD textures
    can use this file. Likewise, having it temporarily installed when lotting means it will work with the Maxis LE.***


    *Note: you only need those files for overrides/mods you have installed.*


    **MAXIS LE TEXTURE OVERRIDES**


    One or Two Maxis LE texture will be overridden when installing this set. All users will have an updated OWR Ortho texture, which fits better with the current NAM. For EU users only, the basic Road
    Ortho texture is overridden to an EU one.


    **ADDITIONAL INFO FOR CREATORS (LOTTERS)**


    V1 includes the following texture sets: Fractionally Angled Roads - FA2 and FA3 Road textures, including Ortho/Diag and FA2-3 transitions - Basic Road, Avenue, OWR & SAM Overlays - Intended to
    compliment the existing Ortho textures by adding Diagonal and Ortho-Diag transitions for these networks. Ortho SAM textures included too - Network "Transition" Textures


    Transition from game networks to lot textures cleanly with these blended transitions - Street Textures


    Need street textures on your lots? This package contains a complete set.


    Water Textures - Some water textures for ponds etc, in two colour variants. By design the first 7 textures should be used in one row, then the second 7 below them.


    I've included JPG reference sheets, showing all the textures in this pack, inside the .zip file. Which should make it very easy to see at a glance what textures are what. Ideally though, I
    recommend using PIM-X (X-Tool, SC4 PIM) for lotting.


    ***IMPORTANT***


    ***It should be noted the IDs for the Street Textures have been changed in this release from the development version. If you have used those previously, you will need to re-lot affected lots or
    keep the original "NAM Streets for LE.dat" file installed. Bear in mind, since users can no longer get the original file, if releasing lots with these textures, you must switch to the new IDs from
    this package. I'm sorry to do this, but I figure few people will be affected and it allows me to better organise my texture IDs into the future.***
