    This package contains a number of textures and HD rendered props for making Tennis scenes in the Lot Editor\*.


    There are textures and props to make tennis courts in Straight, Diagonal and Fractionally Angled (22.5° & -22.5°) rotations. Additionally there are props for Tennis Nets, Court Fencing and a few
    extras that may come in handy when lotting. Prop families have also been used for the Court and Fencing props, which will randomly select one of the available colours/styles.


    It should be noted that this is a Dependency, as such you will not find any new lots as a result of installing this file.


    Huge thanks to KingOfSimCity for providing the inspiration for this pack and the included textures. Also for collaborating with me on the props development.

    This package contains a small convenience store, with three model variations in a buildings family, along with lots to use them. Inside the "Models" folder, please ensure you remove 3 files you
    will not need. Included are models for the following options:


    - HD (High Definition/Better Quality textures)

    - SD (Default texture quality)

    - DN (DarkNite, for users of SimFox's DarkNite mod)

    - MN (MaxisNite, for default lighting)


    So for example, if you are using HD-MN, you should remove the files ending HD-DN, SD-DN and SD-MN, leaving only your preferred choice behind.


    Using my Retail Signage Pack dependency, these stores will show randomly one of the installed Banner/Logo options.


    3 Lots are included:


    - Stage 2 CS$$ 3x2

    - Stage 2 CS$$ 3x3 (Right Corner)

    - Stage 1 CS$$ 4x4.

    Far too long in the works, but finally here, is version 2 of my Filler Set.


    Used together, this set of lots can provide a powerful set of tools to deal with the diagonal jaggies problem and help to create more visually pleasing areas. The basic filler lots are
    texture-based and intended to transition cleanly between Sidewalks, Grass & Concrete textures. Sometimes though, we want to fill half a tile or an unsightly gap, which such fillers alone can't
    handle. Due to game limitations, a lot can either be fully transparent or completely show a texture. If you try to use partial transparency, the water bug appears, which is both ugly and annoying.
    Overhanging Lots can help here, because they do not use textures, but models that display them. So we can use transparency and/or extend textures beyond the boundaries of the lots they are upon.
    The main downside is that such models aren't very slope tolerant.


    During install, you can choose which types, if any, of overhanging fillers to install. Note that different textures include different pieces, I've tried to balance flexibility whilst being mindful
    of the number of menu items. Each sidewalk variant has 8 lots, grass comes with 5 and all others just 2. But, I think for most users that will cover the bulk of situations you will really need.
    Find all installed lots at the top of your Parks Menu. The Extender options are as follows:


    ![DFS_3.jpg.ec1bd2bf5a3d93dcbd225cb4a8b73b](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/screens/monthly_2019_02/DFS_3.jpg.ec1bd2bf5a3d93dcbd225cb4a8b73b1f.jpg)


    Lotters/Tinkerers will find 156 props to play with, 13 for each of the 12 supported textures. So if you are willing to make some lots, it's possible to have every prop type for every network. But
    that wasn't something I felt I wanted to do for various reasons. The complete package runs to 60-ish lots already too, you have to stop somewhere.

mgb204/rail-depot-pack:
  authors:
    - MGB204
  category: props
  description: >-
    This package contains modular rail depot models, rail service platforms plus props (linked to automata) and textures to use with them.


    Whilst the idea of this package is to allow lotters to use them making Rail Depots, there are a number of user-customisable features, that any lots created with this resource can take advantage
    of.


    ***The main depot props have been rendered in three different ways. Two HD versions, containing higher-res textures, with either Maxis Nite or Dark Nite variants. There is also an SD Maxis Nite
    version for those who dislike/can't use HD models.***


    The textures included can be customised during installation to support many different configurations. The automata props are linked to the installed automata for Rail, HSR/Monorail and
    GLR/EL-Rail. This means lots using them will show a users installed automata on them (limitations apply). The Depot and Automata props are provided additionally in three timed groups, for more
    variation.

mgb204/retail-signage-pack:
  authors:
    - MGB204
  category: props
  description: >-
    This package contains props which show banners with retail logos.


    The basic idea is that the props are in a family. That way when the family is used on a lot, one will be randomly selected from the installed props.


    Currently I'm really just testing out the concept. But to get things going, I've made almost 30 banners/props, grouped by 6 countries:


    - AUS - Australia

    - DE - Germany

    - JPN - Japan

    - RUS - Russia

    - UK - United Kingdom

    - US - United States


    Each pack contains between 3 and 6 props, for stores of those countries. Here's the neat part...


    You can choose to install only one region, selected regions or even all of them, it's totally up to you. But whichever you install will dictate which stores appear on lots using the props. For now
    these will support my Convenience Store lots, watch out for those in the coming days. But perhaps there is room to expand on the concept in future.


    One last bonus. I've included some basic resources, 3D Modelling application files, sample texture. Readme for anyone who wants to have a go making their own compatible props. There are two files,
    one .max for 3DS Max users (made with 2011). Along with .3DS which can be imported into SC4BAT, see the included documentation for more info.

  description: >-
    The MGB Texture Pack is intended for lotters and includes a number of useful textures. Of course this file will be a necessary dependency for any lots made using the included resources. Please
    note, there is no content that you will find in-game from installing this download stand-alone.


    **INFO FOR USERS**


    **OPTIONAL OVERRIDES:**


    Optional overrides should be installed in the same folder as the main package, where used. The following options are available:


    - *zMGB Texture Pack_RVT TSR Stret Override - For users of Rivit's TSR Street Mod.*

    - *zMGB Texture Pack_SAM5 RVT Override - For users of Rivit's SAM5 Rural TSR Mod*

    - *zMGB Texture Pack_SAM6 DK Override - For users of my SAM6 Darkened Mod*

    - *zMGB Texture Pack_SAM7 BP Override - For users of my SAM7 Bikepaths Mod*

    - *zMGB Texture Pack_SAM10 SD Override*


    ***Default SAM10 Textures use HD (256x256px) resolution. The LE (Maxis) can not show these textures. But there should be no problems in-game with them.&nbsp;However, those who prefer SD textures
    can use this file. Likewise, having it temporarily installed when lotting means it will work with the Maxis LE.***


    *Note: you only need those files for overrides/mods you have installed.*


    **MAXIS LE TEXTURE OVERRIDES**


    One or Two Maxis LE texture will be overridden when installing this set. All users will have an updated OWR Ortho texture, which fits better with the current NAM. For EU users only, the basic Road
    Ortho texture is overridden to an EU one.


    **ADDITIONAL INFO FOR CREATORS (LOTTERS)**


    V1 includes the following texture sets: Fractionally Angled Roads - FA2 and FA3 Road textures, including Ortho/Diag and FA2-3 transitions - Basic Road, Avenue, OWR & SAM Overlays - Intended to
    compliment the existing Ortho textures by adding Diagonal and Ortho-Diag transitions for these networks. Ortho SAM textures included too - Network "Transition" Textures


    Transition from game networks to lot textures cleanly with these blended transitions - Street Textures


    Need street textures on your lots? This package contains a complete set.


    Water Textures - Some water textures for ponds etc, in two colour variants. By design the first 7 textures should be used in one row, then the second 7 below them.


    I've included JPG reference sheets, showing all the textures in this pack, inside the .zip file. Which should make it very easy to see at a glance what textures are what. Ideally though, I
    recommend using PIM-X (X-Tool, SC4 PIM) for lotting.
