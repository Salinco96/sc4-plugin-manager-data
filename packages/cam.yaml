        **There is a lot of myths about CAM out there. For a beautifully written article about what CAM is really about, see the blog by Tarkus
        [here](https://simtarkus.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/the-cam-colossus-addon-mod-separating-fact-from-fiction/). This article also give a great idea on some great starter buildings.**


        **NOTE: If you have merged your SimCity_1.dat file with the original CAM 1.0 file, restore your original SimCity_1.dat file before running this installer.**


        Welcome to the *Colossus Addon Mod* (CAM). CAM changes the way cities and regions develop. This is possible through the use of *Growth Stages* (Read in Basics of the Manual). This causes the
        game to progress from small stores, single houses and farms/small factories to Commercial Office towers, Residential High Rises and Large industrial factories less rapidly and much more
        *realistically*.


        The altered growth also allows the player better control their cities through the use of *zoning density*. If the player wanted a nice rural town, zone only light density, with some medium in
        larger areas. On the other side, the skyscrapers and other large buildings become more balanced and possible with very developed regions. Use of high density zoning will allow these to grow
        when ready.


        As with any new software or mod, be sure to *read the Readme's* and this guide before installing or using the mod. Page 4 of the manual contains the specifics of installation. The manuals can
        be downloaded or read in both English and Japanese [here](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=17318.0).


        **Description of new Styles**


        **Install Types**:


        - **IR Fix Only** - Will only Patch the SimCity_1.dat file. This will cause IR to be included in the totals for industry for regular SimCity 4. It will also allow normal industrial connections
        to work for IR. All other install types include this already. Original SimCity 4 files are backed up in the folder DocumentsSimCity 4Original SimCity Files


        - **Extended (InvisiChem)** - This is CAM 2.1.0 Standard with extended stage ranges for larger regions. The growth I feel is more balanced and lifelike.


        - **Standard** - Just like CAM 1.0 stages, just the curves have been smoothed out and the range slightly extended.


        - **Rural** - Stages are set for smaller, rural style growth. Stage 15 can happen, it just will be in very large regions and very infrequently.


        - **Midrise** - Stages are set to place an emphasis on growing midrise stages. This is similar to the way European cities grow.


        - **Skyscraper** - Stages have been set to allow Skyscrapers to grow quickly, even in one city regions.


        All stage settings, except for the Extended version, are the values that were originally developed by RippleJet. All the new CAM 2.1.0 fixes have been included in all versions. The only
        difference between types is the stages for specific play style.


        Feel free to add comments here, the CAM General discussions board at SC4Devotion, or if you start a thread here at Simtropolis, let me know so I can be as helpful as possible. Feel free to
        discuss any myths about this mod that have circulated in the past. I will be more than happy to share what this mod is truly about, including how it helps regional play.


        Cheers everyone,


        InvisiChem.
