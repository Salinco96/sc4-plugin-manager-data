    Based on one that I stayed at a couple years back in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, this is a fairly nondescript mid-70s hotel and conference center, akin to what you would see in any sizeable American
    city.


    This building sits on a 7x3 lot and comes in growable and ploppable CS$$ varieties, both of which provide 728 jobs. Both Darknite and Maxisnite versions are provided, of which only one should be
    used at a time. The Darknite version requires [Simfox's Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).


    Dependencies:


    [BSC Common Dependencies Pack](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/3-sc4d-lex-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack) (for those of you unfamiliar with project
    ZIP, I specifically only used the BSC MEGA Props - CP Vol01 component)


    Special thanks to [@Bobelboy](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/138427-bobelboy/) for reminding me that I still had this sitting around and had forgotten to upload it.

  description: >-
    Rapson Library is an early 60s academic building based heavily on the University of Minnesota's Rapson Hall, located on the east bank of the Twin Cities campus. It is named for modernist architect
    Ralph Rapson, who was the head of the university's architecture department from 1954 to 1984. Though Rapson was responsible for a sizeable number of modernist works, perhaps he is best known for
    his [Riverside Plaza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riverside_Plaza) apartment complex, which received mainstream attention when it was featured in the Mary Tyler Moore Show. To be clear, the
    real-world Rapson Hall was not designed by Ralph Rapson, but rather by Thorshov and Cerny, another Minneapolis-based firm.


    As the title suggests, I have modded this building as a library. One dependency is required - [Volume 1 of the Cycledogg BSC texture
    pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/15322-bsc-texture-pack-cycledogg-v01/). As always, I have included two options for the night scene: one that fits with the game's default night
    mode, and one that makes use of [Simfox's delightful darknite mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).
