    The **WMP Essentials v1.0** is a **must have dependency pack** for all the previously released WMP custom contents by **DocRorlach**. It completely replaces the previously released wmp_dummies.dat
    file.


    **This is a dependency package, and it doesn't contain any ploppable or growable elements.**


    **DO NOT USE THIS PACK FOR YOUR OWN LOTTING PROJECTS!!!**


    Since the original workingman-productions.co.uk/ website is no longer up and running, the decision has been made, that these contents of **DocRorlach**'s will be re-hosted on the main exchanges
    ([LEX](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_main.php) and [STEX](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/category/73-workingman-productions-wmp/ "Simtropolis Exchange - Workingman Productions
    (WMP)")) as legacy contents on behalf of **DocRorlach**. For easier access and due to a more userfriendly approach, we put together these mega packs, which are completely replacing the previous
    smaller prop packs.


    This Essential file contains following elements from the previously released WMP creations:


    - all the previously released wmp dummies/blank model files

    - all the different WMP custom queries and UIs from the prop packs, resource files and lot sets.

    - all the custom made TE network paths for the WMP lots (the default paths in the WMP Essentials.dat support RHD setup)

    - **Since the original Causeway set and Boardwalk set had the same custom queries, a new UI property (with new IID) has been added which gives a slightly modified text to the WMP Murimk
    Boardwalks. (NEW!!! WMP Essentials v1.0.1)**

    - as an addition IF you use **Left-Hand Drive (LHD) setup**, you can find a LHD support file in the Documents folder. You need to place/copy that z_\__zWMP_LHD_Paths folder into the
    Plugins\\WMP\\Essentials\\ folder if you used the default/provided folder structue, otherwise it **MUST load after** the WMP Essentials.dat file.


    **Credits**:


    - **DocRorlach**, the **WMP Team** for creating these original contents: custom paths, UIs, dummie model files.

    - David (djp) for keeping the original site alive so many years, and letting us rehosting the files on the exchanges

    - xxdita and Tyberius06 (and the STEX Custodian) for putting together the mega packs and making the files available again.


    **Support**:


    These WMP/DocRorlach creations are now legacy contents and therefore their support is very limited, however support from the wider community can be requested

    **WMP Mega Textures v1.02** is a dependency pack, which superseds many of the previously released single, individual WMP texture packs and the previous WMP Mega Textures by **DocRorlach**.


    **This is a dependency package, and it doesn't contain any ploppable or growable elements. Although it can be used for creating new lots with Maxis Lot Editor or PIM\-X.**


    Since the original workingman-productions.co.uk/ website is no longer up and running, the decision has been made, that these contents of **DocRorlach**'s will be re-hosted on the main exchanges
    ([LEX](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_main.php) and [STEX](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/category/73-workingman-productions-wmp/ "Simtropolis Exchange - Workingman Productions
    (WMP)")) as legacy contents on behalf of **DocRorlach**. For easier access and due to a more userfriendly approach, we put together these mega packs, which are completely replacing the previous
    smaller prop packs.


    Some of the single wmp texture packs and the previous wmp mega textures also contained custom transit (TE) paths, which have been taken out from the new mega texture pack and they will be released
    with the NEW **[WMP Essentials](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/33620-wmp-essentials-v10/)**.


    This new Mega Texture set contains the textures from all the previosly released WMP Texture packs (**WMP Textures 1-10** and the **WMP Mega Textures**) and it also has the textures from the
    previous **wmp_spam_freight_props2**, **rfy_warehouse** and **rfy_cardealer** props, which contained some textures.


    **Also from now, these mega prop packs are required to be referenced as dependencies instead of the single prop packs.**


    *For further details, please read the provided readme AND IF you still have questions, ask [@Tyberius06](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/660284-tyberius06/)*.


    **Credits**:

    - David (djp) for keeping the original site alive so many years, and letting us rehosting the files on the exchanges

    - xxdita and Tyberius06 (and the STEX Custodian) for putting together the mega packs and making the files available again.

    The Bridges of Shoreline County, batte(re)d & lotted by DocRorlach WorkingMan BATtery


    A series of eye-candy only bridges for both rural and urban areas. All bridges, with the exception of the transit-enabled version of the Wooden Bridge (5x1), are 1x1 lots with the respective
    bridge off-set. The covered bridges and the standard wooden bridge are for heights up to 8m; the Hang Ten bridge can cover variable heights and even small rivers or bays. The Pont Tarielle and the
    transit-enabled Wooden Bridge have a clearing height of 5m which is sufficient for cars but not for trucks or buses. Covered bridges have a clearing height of 7.5m. All lots come with a
    transparent base, and should work well with ploppable water.


    **Support**:


    These WMP/DocRorlach creations are now legacy contents and therefore their support is very limited, however support from the wider community can be requested
    [here](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=18355.40) or in the [STEX Custodian General Support
    Topic](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/758502-stex-custodian-general-support-topic). Best include a screen-shot illustrating the problem.

    The Cougar Fruit Packing Ltd. is the latest in the WMP SPAM Workplaces series. Formerly an independent family concern, it was acquired by a global food brand in the late eighties and, during
    season, ships several local apple varieties from the local orchards to markets world-wide.


    Sitting on a 7x6 lot, the company employs 50 permanent staff from the nearby township rather than the transients favoured by the industry in general.


    While all props have been rendered in HD, the main building - due to its complexity - remains an SD export.


    **Lot Details and Information:**


    Lot size: 7 x 6 tiles


    Menu position: Transportation - FreightRail


    Jobs: $ : 45, $$ : 5


    Plop cost: $ 2,200


    Bulldoze cost: $ 1,000


    Monthly cost: $ 110


    Power consumption: 60 MWh/month


    Water consumption: 45 Gallons/month


    Pollution: Water: 5 over 10 tiles; Garbage: 15 over 10 tiles


    **Credits**:


    Thanks go to Rivit for his invaluable assistance in creating the special rail pathing; d_j_p1 for his patient testing of all WMP lots & mods; and Simcoug for suggesting the idea and providing
    research.
