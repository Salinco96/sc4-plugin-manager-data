    The **WMP Essentials v1.0** is a **must have dependency pack** for all the previously released WMP custom contents by **DocRorlach**. It completely replaces the previously released wmp_dummies.dat
    file.


    **This is a dependency package, and it doesn't contain any ploppable or growable elements.**


    **DO NOT USE THIS PACK FOR YOUR OWN LOTTING PROJECTS!!!**


    Since the original workingman-productions.co.uk/ website is no longer up and running, the decision has been made, that these contents of **DocRorlach**'s will be re-hosted on the main exchanges
    ([LEX](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_main.php) and [STEX](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/category/73-workingman-productions-wmp/ "Simtropolis Exchange - Workingman Productions
    (WMP)")) as legacy contents on behalf of **DocRorlach**. For easier access and due to a more userfriendly approach, we put together these mega packs, which are completely replacing the previous
    smaller prop packs.


    This Essential file contains following elements from the previously released WMP creations:


    - all the previously released wmp dummies/blank model files

    - all the different WMP custom queries and UIs from the prop packs, resource files and lot sets.

    - all the custom made TE network paths for the WMP lots (the default paths in the WMP Essentials.dat support RHD setup)

    - **Since the original Causeway set and Boardwalk set had the same custom queries, a new UI property (with new IID) has been added which gives a slightly modified text to the WMP Murimk
    Boardwalks. (NEW!!! WMP Essentials v1.0.1)**

    - as an addition IF you use **Left-Hand Drive (LHD) setup**, you can find a LHD support file in the Documents folder. You need to place/copy that z_\__zWMP_LHD_Paths folder into the
    Plugins\\WMP\\Essentials\\ folder if you used the default/provided folder structue, otherwise it **MUST load after** the WMP Essentials.dat file.


    **Credits**:


    - **DocRorlach**, the **WMP Team** for creating these original contents: custom paths, UIs, dummie model files.

    - David (djp) for keeping the original site alive so many years, and letting us rehosting the files on the exchanges

    - xxdita and Tyberius06 (and the STEX Custodian) for putting together the mega packs and making the files available again.


    **Support**:


    These WMP/DocRorlach creations are now legacy contents and therefore their support is very limited, however support from the wider community can be requested

    This new Mega Texture set contains the textures from all the previosly released WMP Texture packs (**WMP Textures 1-10** and the **WMP Mega Textures**) and it also has the textures from the
    previous **wmp_spam_freight_props2**, **rfy_warehouse** and **rfy_cardealer** props, which contained some textures.

    The Bridges of Shoreline County, batte(re)d & lotted by DocRorlach WorkingMan BATtery


    A series of eye-candy only bridges for both rural and urban areas. All bridges, with the exception of the transit-enabled version of the Wooden Bridge (5x1), are 1x1 lots with the respective
    bridge off-set. The covered bridges and the standard wooden bridge are for heights up to 8m; the Hang Ten bridge can cover variable heights and even small rivers or bays. The Pont Tarielle and the
    transit-enabled Wooden Bridge have a clearing height of 5m which is sufficient for cars but not for trucks or buses. Covered bridges have a clearing height of 7.5m. All lots come with a
    transparent base, and should work well with ploppable water.

    **Credits**:


    - *Original Creditings*: Thanks to everyone around the Pegasus site for their help with our first attempts at the BAT. Credit for the custom pathing of the wooden bridge goes to rivit, ever the
    expert.

    - *Additional Credits:*

        - **DocRorlach** and the **WMP team** and his associates for creating the models, props and the original lots.
        - David (djp) for keeping the original site alive so many years, and letting us rehosting the files on the exchanges
        - Tyberius06 (STEX Custodian) and xxdita for the restoration/rehosting of these contents.
