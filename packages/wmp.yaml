    The Bridges of Shoreline County, batte(re)d & lotted by DocRorlach WorkingMan BATtery


    A series of eye-candy only bridges for both rural and urban areas. All bridges, with the exception of the transit-enabled version of the Wooden Bridge (5x1), are 1x1 lots with the respective
    bridge off-set. The covered bridges and the standard wooden bridge are for heights up to 8m; the Hang Ten bridge can cover variable heights and even small rivers or bays. The Pont Tarielle and the
    transit-enabled Wooden Bridge have a clearing height of 5m which is sufficient for cars but not for trucks or buses. Covered bridges have a clearing height of 7.5m. All lots come with a
    transparent base, and should work well with ploppable water.


    Lot Details and Information can be found in the readme. Read it.

     Support:

    These WMP/DocRorlach creations are now legacy contents and therefore their support is very limited, however support from the wider community can be requested here or in the STEX Custodian General
    Support Topic. Best include a screen-shot illustrating the problem.


    (These very same lots can be/will be found on the LEX too, look for the WMP contents.)
