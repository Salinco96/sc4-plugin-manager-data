  description: >-
    This Polish Primary School lot was made by **Fordoniak** (also known as adrian10 or adik151) and originally was uploaded onto ~~http://www.simcitypolska.pl/~~, which is no longer existing and
    these uploads hasn't been available according to my best knowladge since then.


    Please note with the permission of the Simtropolis Staff Members (Cyclone Boom and CorinaMarie), this file has been uploaded on behalf of Fordoniak. It was not available anymore due to the
    unfortunate demise of the SC4 Polska site. The models and the lots originally were created by **Fordoniak**, but during the restoration attempt they have received an update with the X-Tool (SC4
    PIM\-X) by the STEX Custodian/Tyberius06.


    The upload contains the building model and a primary school lot (updated by X-Tool).


    Before installing, please, check the attached **cleanitol_Fordoniak Polish Primary School.txt** file and if you happen to have the listed files anywhere in your plugins, please remove them.


    **Installation**: Unzip the whole bundle, or COPY the "**Fordoniak**" parent folder from the \*.zip into your plugin folder. You don't need to keep the "*\_Documents*" folder in your Plugins, best
    if you remove it somewhere safe outside of your plugins.


    **To uninstall:** bulldoze any instance of this lot in your city, then remove the file(s) from your Plugins.
