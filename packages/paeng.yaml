  description: >-
    There were these two guys with a faible for bicycles, dreaming how good it would be to have bikes roaming all over the sim-planet... better air, fewer fat people, new business opportunities... So
    they put together their meager resources, leased a run down warehouse, started deforming metal... and built an empire!

    The 'IND and COM' lots are in the 'Landmarks' menu.


    The various 'Parking' lots are in the 'Traffic | Miscellaneous' menu.

    DEVELOPER NOTES


    Many of the lots come in two flavors - urban and rural. You can use the sets together or just one of them. This goes for all the included lots - delete any you do not wish to use.


    Just make sure you always keep the complete folder named *PAMU-Bikes_Resource* installed.


    More detailed infos -e.g. on benefits, randomized and timed props etc.- in the included Read_Me.
