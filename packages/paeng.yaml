  description: |-
    A set of handsome bike paths combined with alley parks to get your bikers off the busy roads and avenues, at the same time providing nice stretches of small parkways for a leisurely stroll...

    See a full catalog of all included pieces in the included **ReadMe**!

    **How to Plan a Bike Path**

    These bike paths are wide enough to have 2-way bicycle 'traffic' - so they are only built on one side of a road. Note that they don't form regular 'networks' with criss-crossing intersections (cross or tee), but instead they usually follow a stretch of road or avenue, detour around COM properties and sometimes just end at some road intersection or a particular building, e.g. a school, a park or similar.

    Since they do block development, you need to be creative in your zoning and in planning your bike paths. Make your zones either face a side road or detour your paths around some of the developments. Combined smartly, you will not 'lose' too much road access. See Readme for more information!

    **Developer Notes**

    Unless noted otherwise, all pieces are sized 1x1. They are cheap to plop and to maintain.

    Mostly they are completely neutral (effects etc.) except for some key pieces - they provide slight desirability perks.

    Note that there are two versions of the bus stop - one is fully functional (Cap: 2000) while the other one is eyecandy, to be used with road top stops or similar.

    All segments are located in the 'Transportation | Miscellaneous' menu with custom icons.

    I'd like to thank my fellow NightOwl **Murimk** who (again ![:)](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/public/style_emoticons/) 'sponsored' a few custom BATs, adding the kind of detail that makes a set 'alive'.
