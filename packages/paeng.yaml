    A set of handsome bike paths combined with alley parks to get your bikers off the busy roads and avenues, at the same time providing nice stretches of small parkways for a leisurely stroll...


    See a full catalog of all included pieces in the included **ReadMe**!


    **How to Plan a Bike Path**


    These bike paths are wide enough to have 2-way bicycle 'traffic' - so they are only built on one side of a road. Note that they don't form regular 'networks' with criss-crossing intersections
    (cross or tee), but instead they usually follow a stretch of road or avenue, detour around COM properties and sometimes just end at some road intersection or a particular building, e.g. a school,
    a park or similar.


    Since they do block development, you need to be creative in your zoning and in planning your bike paths. Make your zones either face a side road or detour your paths around some of the
    developments. Combined smartly, you will not 'lose' too much road access. See Readme for more information!


    **Developer Notes**


    Unless noted otherwise, all pieces are sized 1x1. They are cheap to plop and to maintain.


    Mostly they are completely neutral (effects etc.) except for some key pieces - they provide slight desirability perks.


    Note that there are two versions of the bus stop - one is fully functional (Cap: 2000) while the other one is eyecandy, to be used with road top stops or similar.


    All segments are located in the 'Transportation | Miscellaneous' menu with custom icons.

        A set of lots that add seasonal flora and path color options overlay texture covers for existing Paeng bikepath lots. This also includes a new additional standalone set that provides the
        option of having a second color bike path in your city.


        Why is the name so long you might ask, because so many were involved in getting this project to this point.


        First we have to thank the original creator of the bike paths Paeng. His Bike Paths with Alley Parks is the basis of these bike paths.


        Then we have to thank MGB for his update that added Lights and Seasonal Hedges to the Bike Paths along with some additional lots.


        Though nothing wrong with the bike paths they needed an update and some options to expand the set. In speaking with hugues aroux he agreed to get his minions of cloned Kevins to produce new
        Scoty textures to update the bike paths. He must have promised them second breakfast because they came up with 4 color options along with new planter overlays.


        The 4 color options are Red, Green old, Green new, and Blue. Two versions of each were created a cover set and a double set. You can select one color for the covers set and select a different
        color for the dbl set. Seasonal props from Girafe's Flora Pack were added to the lots along with some small prop adjustments. A set of diagonal lots were also added to expand the pack.


        Within the download folder you will find two folders the Documents folder, with the read me and pictures, and the PHIL Seasonal Paeng MGB bikepaths folder that contains the lots and textures
        and is the folder you place in your plugins folder after selecting your options. This folder should be placed in a location that loads After the Paeng and MGB bikepath files, consider adding
        zz to the front of the folder name.


        In the PHIL Seasonal Paeng MGB Bikepath folder you will find Two folders: the Cover set and the Double or Dbl set.


        Within the Cover folder are the Cover set lots folder and the Scoty TexPaths Cover folder. Choose One of the four cover color files in the Scoty Texpaths Cover folder and store the rest out of
        your plugins folder. This set overrides any existing Paeng and MGB bikepath lots you already may have in your city. It adds 13 additional lots for diagonals that will use the color you picked
        for the covers.


        Within the Dbl folder are the Double set lots folder and the Scoty TexPaths Dbl folder. Choose One of the four dbl color files and store the rest out of your plugins folder. This set is a
        standalone set and can be placed in your city along with the existing original paeng or mgb sets or with the covers set. You can choose a color different from the covers set and have two
        different bikepath colors in your city. The 13 additional diagonal lots are included in this set as well.


        Notes:


        - The covers will work on Paeng's base set of lots, Paeng's SSDP bikepath lots, MGB's Light Project update and it's additional crossover lots, and adds the diagonal lots.


        - Each set has their own new icons for the game menu.


        - The cover set is not a dependency of the dbl set however all original dependencies are still dependencies for the dbl set.


        - No Kevins were harmed in the making of these textures, that one Kevin that fell in the ink well was on a different project.


        - The lots can be found in the Misc transportation menu like the originals.


        - There are slight variations to prop layout on some lots between the cover and dbl set but most follow the same layout.


        - All lots will adjust to your sidewalk mod.


        - Other than the Functional Bustop and Parking Ends these lots do not have additional functions, they do not function like pedmalls.


        Give a Big Thank You to hugues aroux for all the great texture work, icons and help in creating this project. This project is as much his as it is mine.


        A thank you to Paeng for the original set all of this is based on and a thank you to MGB for the work he did on his update and the help he gave in this project.


        Hope you enjoy them,


        ~Phil

    This park system combines three updated versions of previous park sets - *Monument Park*, *Urban Gardens* and *White Sands Park*. Mainly I wanted to create the possibility to lay out a good
    variety of parks, paths and gardens for any type of city - particularly with options for different path textures to be used on the same city tile. You can now have three very distinct park-styles
    in your city, each with its own character (layout, props, textures) - and you can mix and mingle them any which way you please... and even exchange or unify textures as you desire.


    This will enable you to use the paths, prefab parks, ends, transitions, addons and extensions of all three park sets in one glorious citywide park system.


    **OVERVIEW**


    \* Three complete parksystems, each with a unique style, textures, props and individual pieces


    \* A host of possible configurations - Narrow, Wide, Diagonal, Sweeping Curves, Ends, prefab Parks and more


    \* New park 'Sidings' for realistic-looking transitions to your roads and avenues


    \* Transitions between textures and/or sidewalks that can adapt to your preferred sidewalk textures and mods


    \* The ability to exchange or unify the base textures on the fly to suit your taste


    \* The option to mix and mingle sections of all three sets any which way you want


    \* All items designed to create extended lawns to be enhanced with MMP flora of your choice


    \* All items with consistent properties, descriptions and plop helpers, tightly arranged in your menus


    \* A host of overlay textures and custom props to make your own matching lots


    \* Peace of mind that future sets and addons will be made to match all of the above


    Please note that there is a more in-depth [Online Documentation](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/forum/index.php?topic=9813.0) with lots of
    additional info and many images available as well.


    **DEVELOPER NOTES**


    The aim of this overhaul is to 'streamline' the park packs as far as dependencies, general layout and possible variations are concerned. The layout and appearance of the sets have been maintained
    as much as possible.


    Most of the pieces - including the new 'Sidings' - are layed out to give you nice spaces of well-groomed lawn that you can plant with your own choice of flora - bushes, shrubs, flowers and trees
    from your personal MMP collections.


    If you don't want to use any of the sidings, you can safely delete the respective subfile(s).


    If you want to exchange or unify any of the base textures, make sure to carefully read the separate instructions included with the 'Texture Changer 205' module (included, but packed separately).

  description: |-
    This is a set of overlay textures (for pathways) and is a dependency for many of my lots and sets.

    The overlays are for paths of all kinds - narrow and wide paths, straight, curve, tee, cross, diagonal, wide-to-narrow-transitions etc.

    This **updated** version maintains all textures from the previous version and now includes a number of additional matching overlays for more intricate path-variations. Plus some... ;-)

    Lot designers are free to utilize these textures, but the DAT file is not to be included with any download package. Please link to this upload instead.
