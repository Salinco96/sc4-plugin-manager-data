  description: >-
    There were these two guys with a faible for bicycles, dreaming how good it would be to have bikes roaming all over the sim-planet... better air, fewer fat people, new business opportunities... So
    they put together their meager resources, leased a run down warehouse, started deforming metal... and built an empire!

    Others

    Works like a real school, but for a limited number of students - so don't try to skimp on the rest of your education program...


    All other stats like power, water, monthly costs etc. are indicated via the ingame menu.


    The 'IND and COM' lots are in the 'Landmarks' menu.


    The various 'Parking' lots are in the 'Traffic | Miscellaneous' menu.


    The 'Traffic Kindergarten' is in the 'Education' menu.


    They all have custom icons for easy identification.

    DEVELOPER NOTES


    Many of the lots come in two flavors - urban and rural. You can use the sets together or just one of them. This goes for all the included lots - delete any you do not wish to use.


    Just make sure you always keep the complete folder named *PAMU-Bikes_Resource* installed.


    More detailed infos -e.g. on benefits, randomized and timed props etc.- in the included Read_Me.


    RECOMMENDATION


    To add bikes outside of the designated lots we recommended this set of major mode ploppables (optional):


    * Bikes by NBVC
