    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the BSC Team and SC4D LEX Restoration Team-assembled prop packs of popular Japanese BATer APTX_8590, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX)
    at SC4 Devotion. This compilation also contains most (if not all) of the models that APTX ever released on their websites over the years. After battling a number of technical issues, software
    incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form,
    allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    #### Installation


    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.


    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\--or a zip tool capable
    of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org), and for macOS, use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).


    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything).
    Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). On the Cleanup tab, click "Start scan" to find any
    outdated files that currently reside in your Plugins folder that may conflict with this package. Clicking "Backup" will remove these old files to a safe location. (The option to "Delete" them also
    exists, but is not recommended.)\*\* After this, click over to the Install tab, and click "Start installation" to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a
    message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.


    \*\* Though there is an inbuilt cleanitol function in the installer, at this point it is not working entirely properly so it is highly recommended to run the individual cleanitol files or the
    master cleanitol for the compilation with one of the following 3rd party cleanitol tools:


    [nos.17 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/) (new tool)


    BSC Cleanitol (old tool)
