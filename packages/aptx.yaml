    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the BSC Team and SC4D LEX Restoration Team-assembled prop packs of popular Japanese BATer APTX_8590, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX)
    at SC4 Devotion. This compilation also contains most (if not all) of the models that APTX ever released on their websites over the years. After battling a number of technical issues, software
    incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form,
    allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    #### Credits


    The following members contributed models to this collection:


    - APTX_8590

        Bear in mind that most of the models with the original lots created by APTX are still available on the hidden parts of the Hide-inoki (HaS) site as archives:

    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)
