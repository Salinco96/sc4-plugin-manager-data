    The SC4D LEX Legacy - BSC JBSimio Education Compilation contains the popular Education Civic BATs by JBSimio, including the contents of School Pack Volumes 01-04, and the University of Clayhurst
    set, including both the Starter Pack and the Expansion Pack. The stats for the School Packs have been updated using SC4PIM/PIM-X by Tyberius06.


    **Contents**:


    It contains the following BATs from the School Packs:


    - **Lil Red Schoolhouse**

    - **Handley School**

    - **Lincoln Elementary**

    - **Parkside Elementary**

    - **Schultz Memorial High School**

    - **Washington High School**

    - **Central High School**

    - **Manthey Correctional School**

    - **Holy Cross Church and School**

    - **Peace Church and School**

    - **Eisenhower Elementary School**

    - **Westwood Elementary School**

    - **Helen Krump Elementary School**

    - **Roth Elementary School**

    - **John Novac Memorial School**


    Plus the following from the University of Clayhurst Starter Pack:


    - 14 individual Path Lots

    - 6 larger "Quad" Lots

    - 19 Driveway and Parking Lots

    - 3 Academic Classroom Buildings

    - 4 fully functional support Buildings

    - 10 eye candy University Buildings


    And from the University of Clayhurst Expansion Pack:


    - 3 Academic Classroom Buildings

    - 3 University Shuttle Bus Lots

    - 2 fully functional Security Buildings

    - 11 eye candy University Buildings

    - 5 larger "Quad" Lots

    - 3 Driveway and Parking Lots

    - 1 additional Path Lot


    The University of Clayhurst sets rely on the BSC Park Paths for their textures. As such, the BSC Park Textures have been included in this package, so as to avoid an additional dependency, but are
    installed in such a way that they will not interfere with an installation of BSC Parks.


    **Disclaimer**


    The usage of this download is on your own risk. I try to test my lots extensively, so they should work properly, but errors may still exist. Feel free to modify the lots for yourself and show them
    in your city journals, but please don't distribute them without asking first.


    **Credits**


    Special thanks to Andreas Roth who has shown as much enthusiasm and dedication to this project as I have. The custom menu icons and descriptions, installer, readme, and modding the multiple
    languages are all here because of his help. Also thanks to the following people for providing translations:

    Thanks to the BSC and my regular followers for all their feedback and support. I am happy, proud, and honored to work with such knowledgeable and friendly people. Thank you to the amazing people
    at SC4 Devotion for remembering what community is all about and providing a home for all those who love the game.
