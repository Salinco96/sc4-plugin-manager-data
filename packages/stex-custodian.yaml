    The SNT is a project that aims to create overlay textures that can then be used in the Lot Editor. The textures imitate as much as possible the road markings that can be found in Switzerland and
    the rest of Europe, which is why there are two different colors for pedestrian crossings in the textures: yellow for Switzerland and white for Europe. The aim of the SNT is ultimately to cover all
    road networks, be they those of Maxis or NAM, except the Maxis highway and NAM RHW.


    Attention, this pack of textures does not change the appearance of road networks in your city! It is limited for use in the Lot Editor which can be downloaded on SC4 Devotion or Simtropolis. You
    are free to use the textures as you see fit, if you want to create a mod or modify these textures you can do it without my permission.


    The SNT is free to be shared on any site by third parties or to be modified. The original creator of these textures wishes to be completely disassociated from them. This means even if you know who
    they are, do not mention their name in any review, file comment, nor anywhere on the Simtropolis site.


    As of 07.2024 SNT has become a legacy content and will not receive any official updates. If you have any issues please address them in the [STEX Custodian General Discussions on
    Simtropolis](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/758502-stex-custodian-general-support-topic/).
