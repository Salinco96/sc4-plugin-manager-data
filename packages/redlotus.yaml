    Tired of having to clear out a message box full of useless news items? Or are you sick of missing important messages because you were ignoring all of the junk that your advisors were throwing at
    you?


    The end is here. This mod eliminates nearly all of the useless 'news items' that keep popping up.


    **Version History:**


    V1.2:


    Fix by [@DrFrankinStein93](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/826662-drfrankinstein93/): fixed a bug that made the airport upgrade prompt unavailable even though requirements were met.


    V1.1:


    Fixed a bug that made rewards unavailable even though requirements were met. I had to allow all City Planner messages through in order to fix this, so you will have more messages coming through.


    V1.0:


    Rather than listing the many messages that were deleted, here is a list of the types of messages you will still get:


    Reward and Airport Upgrade alerts.


    All messages that contain direct links to problem areas.


    Messages that warn you about underfunded civic buildings where a strike is imminent.


    Disaster and Strike Messages.


    Population Milestones (I took out most of the other "Good Job" messages, so I had to leave something).


    Reward 'news-only' items.


    A few misc 'run-once' news items.
