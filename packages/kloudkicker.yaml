    Brought to you by Kloudkicker Industries. This is a AMPS Certified Mod.


    This pack provides you with 33- 1x1 and 1x2 lots and 4- TE street lots. For a total of 37 lots, and can be found in the power menu. These transformers are for use in small areas and do not require
    road access (except the 4 TE lots), or when you only need a little more power but don't need a full scale plant or substation.


    All the lots are designed to blend into their appropriate surrounding's as best as possible while giving a variety of looks. Some lots use family props, so they wont look the same with each plop.
    No jobs, no water used and no pollution produced. You can pick and chose which set or sets you would like to use. Pick just 1 set to all 7 of them, your choice. Just remove the set('s) your not
    using from the Plugins folder.


    These lots can be used as mini independent power stations. Or used as they were deigned to be, intended as core files for a mod underdevelopment and is in testing stages called AMPS. The AMPS
    (Allied Municipal Power of Simtropolis) mod is underdevelopment and is in testing stages. More information can be found in the AMPS Development Thread.

    Credits:


    I would like to thank RobertaME, for all of her valuable time and hard work with these lots. Simmer2 for props that I love to use, BSC team for the awesome props, and the NAM team for using their
    textures, and thanks to CorinaMarie and RalphaelNinja for the old prop files. I used them before I realized I was not suppose to use them. Also I would like to thank you to all of the Simtropolis
    community, SC4D and Maxis of course. But a Big Thanks goes to Dirktator, the founder of Simtropolis, for starting Simtropolis in 2002. Thank you Everyone.


    This lot was designed by me(Kloudkicker) and by RobertaME. These lots have been tested and moded to match real life as much as possible. Much care has been take to ensure that there are no errors,
    but this does not mean that errors do not exist. How can anyone ensure that when the game is not perfect itself? Use at your own risk.

    One 4x4 plopable high tech industrial facility found in the utilities menu. This lot DOES NOT produce power, however it does produce 222 High Tech jobs.


    The Wind Farm Maintenance Facility is the center of operations for servicing wind turbines. Wind energy is an important part of the increasing need for renewable energy. The wind turbine industry
    is rapidly growing along with the services needed to repair them. This kind of facility provides the necessary infrastructure to service the ground turbines when they are in need of maintenance.
    The service men and women don't work from home, they need this wind farm maintenance facility in your city. Hurry and build one today!


    Stats:


    Lot Size: 4x4


    Plop Cost: $1,000


    Monthly cost: $100
