    **Details/Development**


    This mod involved editing the effects directory and numerous FSH files, 3d models and a few exemplars. This was a best effort mod, as some things can't be fixed as the main exe might be
    controlling them, this can be seen with the lights, the brightness can only be raised to a certain point at night. It also involved hex editing a few animated 3d models which took a long time to
    do, and also was a best effort attempt. If you like the mod then use it, if you don't then no one forcing you to use it, **I WILL NOT be changing anything on this mod, it's final in regards to the
    following; the darkness level, the brightness of all the lights**. If it's a bug or something you think I may of missed let me know and I'll look into it.


    **\*\*This mod may not work properly with certain MODS, BATS, and other ADDONS\*\***


    (Possible sources of conflicts might include water texture mods, mods that edited the lighting and terrain exemplar properties, and mods and BATS that use custom lights)

    The older, but still used **Vehicle_Props-V3.dat** file, as a dependency for many contents all over the exchanges has been merged with the later recommended **Vehicle Props v4.0.dat** and now they
    form the <ins>**Vehicle Props v5.0.dat**</ins>. Bear in mind that these props are the very same apart from the Instance IDs.

    **Details**


    This mod is a effect placed on a lot that has to be plopped in your city, the effect starts randomly after the first of year. If you don't see the clouds/rain at all after that, you may have to
    bulldoze the lot and place it somewhere else as the effect may be out of bounds, this isn't something that I have control over since the effect is on a lot and has no way of running on its own.
