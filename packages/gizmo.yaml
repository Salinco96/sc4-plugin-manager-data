    Details


    This mod is a effect placed on a lot that has to be plopped in your city, the effect starts randomly after the first of year. If you don't see the clouds/rain at all after that, you may have to
    bulldoze the lot and place it somewhere else as the effect may be out of bounds, this isn't something that I have control over since the effect is on a lot and has no way of running on its own.

        Plop Cost: $10,000

       Monthly Cost: $1,000

       Monthly Income: N/A

       Menu Location: Water Utilities, Gizmo_Weather_Plant

       Lot Size: 6 x 7

       Lot Effects: -500 water pollution in a 75 tile radius, 7500 water produced,
    100 power consumed, and 500 water consumed.

       Requirements: Power, water and road connections.
