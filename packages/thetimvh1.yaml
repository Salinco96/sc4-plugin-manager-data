    Just a medium-sized 2x2 hockey rink to compliment the 1x2 lot released by 20huskies.


    As a fan of his work, I have enjoyed following his posts, and noticed that some of the images he's posted on various on-site forums include a 2x2 custom version of his Hockey Rink lot, though for
    some reason he has chosen not to upload it to the STEX (his choice, of course). Therefore, I decided to recreate it myself, and with his blessing, am uploading it to the STEX.


    All credit goes to 20huskies, of course. After all, this is merely a recreation of something he himself made for his use in-game.


    To install simply place the file into the main 20huskies' Hockey Rink folder.


    Make sure you have the following dependencies installed as well.


    20huskies Hockey Rink (optional, but highly recommended).


    20huskies W2W Stadium Village Pack 02 (required)


    BLaM Blank (required).


    SimFox Day and Nite Modd (optional)


    Note: Update 2.0 fixes a problem with the lot not appearing in-game due to a lot ID conflict coupled with the main model being tied to the original lot. Thankfully, I managed to obtain a prop
    variant of said model courtesy of 20huskies himself, thereby allowing me to relot this relot (sounds weird, I know) in a manner that fixes the aforementioned problem. Said prop is of course
    included in the download (with 20huskies' kind permission, of course).


    For those of you who already downloaded the original release of this relot, I strongly recommend you redownload it. Otherwise, it likely won't show up at all in-game.


    Enjoy, TheTimvh1

  description: >-
    My first upload to the STEX, this is intended to be an addon to RRetail's excellent relots of Heblem's old collection of Gas Stations.


    Unfortunately, Heblem took said gas station lots down from distribution years ago, and though both RRetail and Paeng made relots for said gas stations using his props (which still are available,
    thankfully), they never actually included all of them in their respective sets. Thus, I have decided to do so myself, with RRetail's kind permission, of course.


    I claim no credit for the lots themselves, I have only taken some of the lots and swapped out some props (I also moved and/or deleted some props to prevent unnecessary clutter). Best of all, they
    do not replace the originals. They can be used alongside them with no problem whatsoever. All credit belongs to RRetail for the base lots, Paeng, for the generic gas station name and layout, and
    of course, Heblem, for the amazing Gas Station props he created. To install, simply drop the folder into the main RR Gas Station Relots - Version 2.0 folder within your plugins.


    The following lots are used as a base for the new Gas Stations:


    Citgo (2x3)


    Conoco


    Esso


    Hess (3x3)


    PetroCanada


    Shell (3x3)


    BP Connect


    Texaco


    Sunoco (3x3)


    LukOil


    Union 76 (1x3)


    Cheapo (generic gas station; name and layout “borrowed” from Paeng's Gas Station Pack)


    The following Dependencies are required in order to ensure proper functionality):

    Long John Silver's


    My third upload is a stand-alone classic Long John Silver's restaurant using RRetail's excellent props. Nothing too exciting, but hey, I'm sure even a few of your own Sims don't mind dangerously
    greasy yet somehow still delicious fish and chips, shrimp, cole slaw and hush puppies, never quite being able to figure out which one of the deep fried fillets is the "fish" and which one is the
    "chicken", even after eating it; all the while hoping to stave off their next inevitable visit with their local physician.


    The lot is 3x3 tiles in size, and is made with Lot Editor. The following dependencies are required to avoid brown boxes (or colored smudges, if using Pegasus' OPPS/OOPS mod):
