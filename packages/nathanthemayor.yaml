    Well, people, after 1 year I have decided to release the final version of my Capital District Sign Pack. These signs were made for the Exit 5-6 on the Capital Beltway in my CJ The United Cities.
    Ever since V. 1.2(Which I am removing), the textures have been redone, with my new sign style, and the design slightly changed. The billboard style allows it to work with all highway networks. All
    the signs are rendered in HD quality

    This new upload by NTM contains 6 "New-style" highway signs from the Fresno metropolitan area. Unlike the signs in my previous pack, all these signs are different because they have the exit
    numbers on the top, which is typical of US signs. All the signs are on transparent lots and have in-game descriptions.
