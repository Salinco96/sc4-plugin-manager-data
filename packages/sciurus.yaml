    Hello everybody !


    Here it is... the waited S54 PropPack Vol.1 from the KSTeam. This propack includes many props I use in my own LOTs and Krasner use too. It'll be very usefull to make your LOTs more frenchy or just
    european... this download includes a file .dat which groups prop families from Girafe vehicules. So the following sentence is very important !


    Thank you for reading and enjoy this prop pack. Next uploads will come in the next days. Stay tuned..
