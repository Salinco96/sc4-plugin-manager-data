    FA2 High Rise Set


    By Kel9505


    Based off of EffTheGrid's models: FA2 High Rises 01.


    Included are eight FA2 lots based off of EffTheGrid's original eyecandy lots and models. There are 4 buildings and two lots per building (left and right side for FA2 roads). The building stats are
    as follows:


    1\. FA2 Cocoa Exchange: Ploppable R$$$ Residential growify lots with 291 residents.


    2\. FA2 Citysphere Growify: Ploppable R$$ Residential growify lots with 1275 residents.


    3\. FA2 Rhodes Haverty Residence Inn: Ploppable CS$$ lots with 440 workers.


    4\. FA2 TD Bank at Cadman Plaza: Ploppable CO$$ lots with 2064 workers.


    These are LOTS ONLY, and does not include the model. They are a new lots and do not overwrite EffTheGrid's original landmark eyecandy lots.


    Note: This mod requires DLL dependencies by Null45. DLL Dependencies are ONLY available for version 1.1.641 of SimCity 4 (Windows Digital Copies). All dependencies listed below are REQUIRED for
    this RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod to work. For more information about compatible versions of Simcity4 and DLL mods, see here:

    REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES:


    1\. [FA2 High Rises 01](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/34705-fa2-high-rises-01/), by EffTheGrid:


    2\. [Growify DLL Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36180-growify-plopped-buildings-cheat-dll-plugin/) by Null45:


    TO INSTALL:


    Make sure Simcity4 is not running prior to installation.


    Extract all files into your Simcity4 Plugins folder. The archive can be extracted into a subfolder containing EffTheGrid's models and original lots.


    TO USE:


    Pause the game, plop the respective lot along a FA2 street. For the residential lots, use the Growify cheat code "Growify R M" or "Growify R H" to growify the lot as medium density or high density
    lots. The commercial lots do not need the growify cheat but can merely be plopped. Make sure all lots have water and power or, like any other lot, it may abandon. If you have the submenu DLL mod
    by memo, the lots will appear in the Residential Zone menu and Commercial Zones menus under the respective R$$, R$$$, CS$$ and CO$$ Ploppables submenu item.

    RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod, by Kel9509


    v1.0 - May 10, 2024


    v1.1 - July 27, 2024


    Using new DLL functionality for Simcity4 created by Null45.


    Based off of v1.2 of Equinox's "RCI Query Upgrade Mod", originally written and conceptualized by Equinox.


    Thank you Null45 for your amazing DLL mods, and Equinox for your amazing original RCI Query Upgrade!


    This is a mod to upgrade the Maxis query for Residential. Commercial, and Industrial buildings. It is built off of Equinox's original RCI Query Upgrade mod, which first showed improved statistics
    for your growable buildings (including cap status). This RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod improves upon Equinox's original work by adding new statistics available with the use of DLL mods created and
    designed by Null45. Outside of this mod, most of these new statistics are currently not available anywhere else.


    This mod also fixes some errors in the original Equinox Mod, which incorrectly used City and Regional Total Workforce (aka: all Commercial and Industrial Jobs) to represent only Commercial Jobs.
    In addition, the terms used in this RCI DLL Query Mod are more precise, referring to Capacity (the total possible availability) instead of incorrectly using the term Population. Also, the
    placement of the My Sim icon has been corrected.


    Finally, there are some stylistic improvements from Equinox's Queries. The Demand Cap line is bolded instead of the Tile Density line, and the presentation of information has been standardized
    across all Queries so that the same information is displayed as consistently as possible.


    VERSION 1.1 RELEASE NOTES:


    \- Added a Building Lot Growth Stage indicator to show the Stage that the lot grows under.


    \- Expanded the room of the Building Style display, so it can show many more building styles available for a building.


    \- Fixed some typos in the Residential Query to ensure there's enough space and make it consistent with the Commercial and Industrial Queries. Now supports showing up to 999,999,999 Sims in the
    city and in the region, for those with very large cities and regions.


    \- Added the MySim name, as well as support for the MySimtropolis: Members Immortalized in SC4 mod, and moved the icon to be more compact with the overall Query.


    REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES:


    The RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod will not work unless the following dependencies are installed:


    1\. [Query Tool UI Extensions DLL for SimCity 4](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36202-query-tool-ui-extensions-dll-for-simcity-4/), by Null45


    2\. [SC4MoreDemandInfo](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35978-sc4moredemandinfo/), by Null45


    Note that to use DLL mods, if your OS is earlier than Windows 10 you will need to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute.


    https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe


    OPTIONAL DEPENDENCIES:


    These dependencies are optional, but the RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod is designed to use them:


    1\. [Allow More Building Styles - DLL Plugin](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36112-allow-more-building-styles-dll-plugin/), by Null45


    2\. [Startup Performance Optimization DLL Plugin](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36244-startup-performance-optimization-dll-for-simcity-4/), by Null45


    3\. [MySimtropolis: Members Immortalized in SC4](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/32690-mysimtropolis-members-immortalized-in-sc4/), by CoriBoom (CorinaMaria and Cyclone Boom):


    \*\*\*\*INSTALLATION\*\*\*\*


    FIRST - If you have Equinox's original RCI Query Upgrade Mod, remove it from your Plugins folder. This mod is incompatible with Equinox's Query as it uses the same functionality and, like his mod,
    will overwrite the default Maxis RCI Query.


    SECOND - This mod requires DLL dependencies by Null45. DLL Dependencies are ONLY available for version 1.1.641 of SimCity 4 (Windows Digital Copies). All REQUIRED dependencies listed are needed
    for this RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod to work.


    TO INSTALL:


    Make sure Simcity4 is not running prior to installation.


    Extract all files into your Simcity4 Plugins folder.

    \*\*\*\* TECHNICAL INFORMATION \*\*\*\*


    This RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod is best used by those familiar with the way Simcity4 works. That is, you know the basics of the game and understand that population growth in Residential,
    Commercial, and Industrial zones are limited by percentage Demand Caps (except for Commercial Service zones, which have no Caps) that prevent that particular zone's growth until they are "lowered"
    with the placement of parks, rewards, and particular civic buildings in order to increase population and job amounts.


    The new status noted above with an \* (asterisk) provide additional information about the Capacities of these zones in your city and region.


    Demand amounts (aka: total accumulated demand) and "Active Demand" (the available demand currently active for a particular zone's growth) is shown for all zome types. This information is new for
    Commercial Services and Industrial-Ag. Cap amounts for Industrial-Ag are shown for the first time direct from the Simcity4 code as well (instead of as a function like in the Census Repository).


    Building Occupancy and Capacity is shown at all wealth levels for a particular zone style, indicating the amount of occupants and capaacity if a building were to dilapidate. The Industrial Query
    does not have those Building Occupance and Capacity stats (although they exist as functions in the DLL), because those buildings do not dilapidate but instead just abandon if undesired. Building
    occupancy and capacity amounts will be shown as zero for a zone style that does not apply (for instance, a Commercial Services building will show 0 in Occupancy and Capacity for CO$$ and CO$$$),
    or for a wealth level that would not apply (a CS$ building will show 0 in Occupancy and Capacity for CS$$ and CS$$$, because it cannot exceed its current wealth).


    Building Style will show a building's available styles. The Query includes room for additional building styles if the Allow More Building Styles DLL Mod is used.
