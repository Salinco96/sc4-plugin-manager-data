    UPDATE on 24.01.2022

    - nothing new, just a bit of re-branding in the folder and zip name and folder structure. If you already downloaded it since the last update (04.01.2022), you don't need to redownload it.


    UPDATE 04.01.2022


    This JENX-Porkie Expanded Porkie Props is completely replacing the following contents:


    PorkieProps-Vol1.dat

    PorkieProps-Vol2.dat

    JENXPARIS_Tweaked_PorkieProps-Vol1.dat


    It contains props/models (mostly offset props) from several Porkissimo uploads like Paramounth Opera, Rue Meyerbeer, Large Police Department, also it contains the props based on the Porkie Props
    vol01 models from the JENXPARIS_Prop_Pack_Vol02.dat.


    Xannepan's note on the revisited JENXPARIS_Tweaked_PorkieProps-Vol1.dat which was released with the Quais de Seine sets:

      Quote

    - The JENXPROP_Tweaked_PorkieProps-Vol1.dat replaces PorkieProps-Vol1.dat. I activated anti-aliasing on some of these props, which gives a better results. Additionally I created prop families to
    allow for some variation.




    Credit goes to @Porkissimo for all the models and most of the props, also for Xannepan for the additional editing and props and prop families.

    This compilation (and some editing) was made by Tyberius06


    Since now the LEX also have this prop pack, it made only sense to update the original one here to the same version. This version is completely backwards compatible, it doesn't have any negative
    effect on existing uploads.


    ***********************************************************************************************


    A few props you may need to make your streets a bit more "alive". Most of them are night-enlighted, so don't forget that they must not be put across the lot limit in the LE (they would lose their
    nitelite in the game).


    [PK-tunnel top] and [PK_tunnel whole] must be stacked exactly at the same place on your lot.


    The buses only show up a few hours in the day.


    The newspapers shop's appearance changes in the middle of the night.


    The Christmas stuff only appears between december 15th and january 14th.


    Enjoy!
