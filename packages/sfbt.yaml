    Following in jeronij's footsteps, this is another "all inclusive" mod that changes the look of your streets. The main focus is set to residential streets; however, a few commercial and
    agricultural zones can be altered as well. Other optional files will also change the look of the default Maxis trees on roads and oneway roads. The main goal of this mod is to add trees to streets
    in residential zones, as well as parked cars, which is a very common sight throughout Europe.


    This mod is fully modular, so you can decide which street and road tiles should be affected by the mod, and you can also decide which trees should show up there. For this purpose, several street
    tree DATs have been created. It's even possible to mix the various tree styles, however the result will look best when you only install one DAT at once. More tree style DATs can be created later
    to use trees by other designers as well. Unfortunately, this method doesn't work for seasonal trees, but a seasonal tree version of this mod might be released later.


    Depending on wealth type and zone density, the look of the streets varies. You won't see any cars parked on the curb in high-wealth low density zones, and only medium and high density zones will
    have parking bays and dirt circles for the trees. Please note that the DATs for roads and oneway roads will only change the trees, but they do not add any cars or parking bays to your roads. The
    DAT for agricultural zones doesn't add any cars or parking bays either.


    You can install or uninstall the mod at any time you want. To update your streets with the new look (or the default Maxis look again), simply select the street tool and click on your streets, i.
    e. on the crossroads. The props will change automatically in a radius of a few tiles. By clicking more than one time, you can also alter the appearance of the trees, in case the first click didn't
    meet your liking for some reason. If brown boxes are showing up, please make sure you have all dependencies, as listed below.


    **Compatibility**


    This download requires SimCity 4 incl. the "Rush Hour" expansion pack or SimCity 4 Deluxe.


    This mod is not compatible with any other street mod, such as jeronij's streetside mod, ardecila's street tree mod, swamper77's no palm mod (however, the files that remove the palms from lots etc.
    will work fine) or Pegasus' no street junk mod. If other mods that modify the look of the streets are installed, only the one that is loaded last will determine the appearance in the game.

        The plugin: SFBT Street Tree Mod, by Andreas, available on [ST : bsc-sfbt\-street-tree-mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/16098-bsc-sfbt-street-tree-mod/) -- [SC4E :
        86-sfbt\-street-tree-mod](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/23-transportation-mods/86-sfbt-street-tree-mod) offers in the directory: Street Tree Mod\\Street Mods\\


        a set of T21\-type files (15) which place a number of Props along the street: mainly trees, parking bays and cars, and more... ; depending on the nature of the street (wealth, density, Zone).


        Some of these files, despite Andreas's hard work - great for 2006! - contained a few errors in the placement, overlapping and orientation of bays and other accessories...


        So I revised all 170+ of T21 exemplars.


        Mainly: I repositioned the parking bays and cars towards the edges of the street - out of the traffic lane, and I repositioned the benches, trees, hydrants, ... straddling the parking spaces.

        This may have been deliberate for some, but I find them rather strange and unsightly. I've also removed the «big potted flowers»!
