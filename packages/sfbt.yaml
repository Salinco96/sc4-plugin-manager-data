    The SFBT Essentials contain the custom UIs that every SFBT lot uses, as well as shared textures and prop packs. The file will be updated from time to time, so please check back to this download
    once in a while.


    SFBT Essentials


    *   Includes contents directly installable by .zip, and the original installer in the \_DOCUMENTS folder.


    !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!----IMPORTANT----!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


    The **SFBT Essentials 2015** contains the installer due to the choosable tree replacement option on several lots. The main folder contains only the main files of the Essentials by default. If you
    install the SFBT Essentials manually, then you should check in the _\_DocumentsSFBT\_ReadMe_ and from the **\_Trees Replacement** folder copy the choosen files (**after you read the readme about
    how to handle them**) into the main folder of the Essentials.Â 

    You will also find the installer in the _\_Documents\_INSTALLER_ folder.
