    European house Add-on is an effort to make your city's more variable in terms of housing, commercial and industry without either filling much your plugins folder nor unbalance the game. This is
    archived by a simply addition to the maxis original building families, which allows you to have more buildings and at the same time less space taken by dependencies and lot files.


    This building was made in accordance with the size of the Maxi's original building and it's occupant capacity. The rest of the values were archived using the PIM\-X, which provides the best
    balanced values possible at the moment.


    This building is also multi-language, supporting at least Portuguese, Spanish, French, Italian, English (UK and USA) and German. But other languages may be included.

    This is (and I hope it to be the only one) dependency pack from me. here you will find (most of them Portuguese) textures and props, and most of my next releases will need this one.

    It includes a Cleanitol file, so when installing it, run it ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif)

    Check for the updates, this will be only file.. you can see the version on the top.
