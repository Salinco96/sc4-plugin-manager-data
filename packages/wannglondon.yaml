    After another viewing of *L.A. Confidential*, I created a pack of four homes (and a lotted bungalow court) found all over beautiful Los Angeles, California (my home). These sprung up all over the
    city in the 1920s and there are a plethora of them still around today, also found in neighboring cities. I personally love them and even lotted a bungalow court (another LA favorite style of
    mine).

    It has always astonished me how few BATs there are from beautiful San Francisco, California. This is my attempt to help close that gap.
