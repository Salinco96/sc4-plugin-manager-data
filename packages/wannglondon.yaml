    After another viewing of L.A. Confidential, I created a pack of four homes (and a lotted bungalow court) found all over beautiful Los Angeles, California (my home). These sprung up all over the
    city in the 1920s and there are a plethora of them still around today, also found in neighboring cities. I personally love them and even lotted a bungalow court (another LA favorite style of
    mine).
