        Hello Community! Here are some old rowhomes I created which were uploaded to the LEX and I never uploaded them here. There are also some in this pack that have never been uploaded before. These are based on the pretty rowhomes found in Chicago, New York, and Philadelphia.

        \- Medium & High Wealth residential 1x2 lots

        \- DarkNite versions only

        \- Townhomes 3 were included in the New York pack upload

  description: Began as a test and I actually became satisfied with the results. Absolutely horrendous lotting on my part, so please feel free to re-lot with the PIM/Lot Editor. Functions as a park stadium in-game. Also, I readjusted the LODs in the PIM so the shadows are off, but it you re-lot as-is, the shadows should show properly. Sits on a 6x6 lot size.

        LA has its fair share of chateau-inspired architecture and during a recent outing these style of apartment buildings really inspired me. I have created two versions; one with and one without the rooftop sign (very common here in Los Angeles).

        After another viewing of *L.A. Confidential*, I created a pack of four homes (and a lotted bungalow court) found all over beautiful Los Angeles, California (my home). These sprung up all over the city in the 1920s and there are a plethora of them still around today, also found in neighboring cities. I personally love them and even lotted a bungalow court (another LA favorite style of mine).

        \- Houston tileset

        And I did finally use a dependency on these lots, Barocco Hispano's trees [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/34720-agc-environment-dlc/). Thanks, mate!

        Feel free to re-lot as desired as I am not a very great lotter.
