    **SM2 Essentials v4** includes recurrent family/timed sets and many often used textures.

    This Essential pack must always be in your plugin if you wish to use my lots! Failure to do so will result in issues with many SM2 files.

    Warning! Remove the old SM2 Essentials From your plugin before installing this version!!

    Please use BSC Cleanitol and the "SM2 Cleanitol for Essential v4.txt" file included with this essential pack to remove several redundant files from old lots and packs.

    This Essentials pack will be updated from time to time and it will be required to be re-downloaded when necessary. Proper warning will be given on future uploads.

    Thank you.

    **SM2 Mega Prop Pack Vol1** is a compendium of 670 models I created over the years. It replaces many files and eliminates the need to have many dependencies.

    Please use the included cleanitol text file. It is very important to do so as to avoid redundant and unnecessary files taking up space in your plugin.

    Many lots are being updated to point to this file.

    Besides the usage of the cleanitol files no further action is required.

    Thank you
