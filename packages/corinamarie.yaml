    **Give yourself *much more* mayoral control.**

    In our 5th official *CoriBoom*™ release to the STEX, [@CorinaMarie](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/737259-corinamarie/) and I are proud to finally present a mini (yet magnificent) mod which allows much finer control of city simulation growth:

    **NKO**

    This mod grants the flexibility to have all 3 wealth levels (low, medium, high) coexist in any given location, without the higher wealths gobbling up the lower ones. This is a vast improvement over the default game setting, where the two lowest wealths can upgrade to a higher wealth. While this behaviour is desirable in certain situations, it forces you (the mayor) to mark lots as historical as a preventative measure. This can be a tedious process which soon becomes a boring chore. (Like washing dishes.)

    The default automatic upgrades are a common cause of population instability and a major factor causing the dreaded *no job zots*. In regular gameplay, a higher wealth and stage often takes over before the conditions are suitable. NKO fixes the method which the SC4 simulation uses. By doing so, the control is now at your fingertips to decide when a wealth level should be allowed to upgrade and replace a lower wealth.

    For example with houses, it means R$ can coexist within an area containing R$$ homes, and even R$$$ mansions too! There's no need to mark each as historical for preventing them from being destroyed and replaced with higher wealth. This finer control means there's *significantly* less micro management involved to ensure RCI growth sustainability.

    Then if one wishes, the bulldozing tool is useful for giving the green light for a higher wealth to take its place. At this point, certain zones will reassess and grow what the simulation deems as appropriate (based on the RCI demand and local desirability factors).

    **What does "****Kickout****" mean?**

    The standard SC4 growth simulation automatically allows lower wealths to be replaced by higher wealth levels. This means they can be taken over and redeveloped by a higher wealth at any time the game decides. When this happens, the process of such is described as "kicking out" the lower wealth level.

    What NKO does is prevent this from happening by setting a Boolean **False** toggle.

    In the [exemplar](https://www.wiki.sc4devotion.com/index.php?title=Exemplar_properties#Building_Development_Simulator) property:

    **Tract Developer Kick Out Lower Wealth**

    Name Value: **0x47E2C540**

    **Does NKO prevent higher wealth ever growing?**

    No, not at all. Any new zone will develop just as before based on economic conditions in your city. And you now have the choice of when any given grown lot should be allowed to redevelop.

    Tax rates can be adjusted accordingly to encourage the development of certain RCI types. This is related to the methods explained in Cori's [Residential Revamping](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/757812-selective-residential-revamping/) tutorial. Then should one later wish to upgrade an area, it's possible to selectively bulldoze. At that point, it provides higher wealths an opportunity to reconsider and grow in place when they're able.

    As a result, it gives you (as mayor) the ability to decide if you wish to grow something else instead.

    **Power of the Bulldozer**

    Via the bulldozer tool, it gives us an ***expansive freedom*** to develop RCI how we wish to. NKO isn't a restrictive mod, but a revision of the simulation and this puts the city design decisions in our own hands.

    The bulldozer is our friend for this very reason. It means how if wanting to redevelop areas to higher capacity, then using the tool makes way to allow R$$ or even R$$$ buildings too, because then the demand and desirability decides. This applies to residential, commercial and industrial inclusive.

    For residential and if wanting R$ to stay, then they will do. This could be useful for maintaining a lower wealth area of housing. However, once bulldozing to bare zoning and it's a free for all again. ![*;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_2.gif "*;&#41;")

    **Completely CAMpatible**

    NKO is fully compatible with the CAM too.

    By comparing the properties in the exemplar which NKO uses too, we've made sure that the same properties are added along with the setting toggled to prevent lower wealths being kicked out. Just makes sure NKO loads after CAM does, so that way it'll be applied.

    **A Couple of Things**

    Thing **#1**

    NKO works very well combined alongside [@Bones1](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/48348-bones1/)'s [Less Abandonment](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/14931-less-abandonment/) mod.

    This is recommended when CAM is not installed. (Which has its own version of Less Abandonment built in.)

    What the "Less Abandonment" mod does is make sure the city is ready for RCI development when the demand for growth is much more likely to be sustainable.

    As such it fits along well in harmony with what NKO does. It sets the threshold higher for when buildings will grow, which means they're more likely to stick around once they do sprout.

    Thing **#2**

    A caveat you should be aware of:

    NKO does **not** prevent buildings from upgrading **within their own wealth class**.

    This means if you have some lower capacity building you want to keep for aesthetic reasons, you'll still need to click the historical option for it. ![*;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_2.gif "*;&#41;")

    It is rarer for this to happen in a stable city, but it does occur and well worth being mindful of.

    **Complete NKO Overview**

    To learn more of the advantages to using NKO, see the following thread we made:

    It contains picture previews to show the real benefits of what NKO provides. Also this doubles up as the official *Support Thread* if you've any comments or questions we can answer.

    Replying to the Comments section here on the file entry is fine too if you'd prefer.


    We hope you enjoy using NKO in your cities!

    **It's time to explore *Park Effect* in Data View form.**

    In our 4th official *CoriBoom*™ release to the STEX, [@CorinaMarie](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/737259-corinamarie/) and I are delighted to present a mod which represents the effects of Parks Aura as a Data View.

    SimCity 4 is an intricate and creative city building simulation, featuring extensive information for how interactions are connected with various wide-ranging gameplay variables.

    Much of this happens under the hood, and so it's not always plainly evident exactly what's going on.

    There are ways to observe and determine the desirable and more unsavory parts of town. In terms of a visual representation though of aura effects, this isn't directly defined as displayed data. As such it might not be apparent just how far the negative aura spreads from the local landfill, or the positiveness generated from plopped parks. By knowing this information, it's possible to make design decisions based on what it means.

    As we've all become familiar with the standard offering of mayoral tools, **Cori's Parks Aura** is a mod you may not have realized might ever be useful. However, we believe it is *very* much so. ![*;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_2.gif "*;&#41;")

    What this allows is a completely new perspective into the diverse interactions of the simulation, and to determine more distinctly the reasons for residential development in different locations.

    **Background Info**

    Parks Aura is a primary YIMBY factor in SC4 which allows residential development to thrive. However in the game, this data is hidden away in the simulation and cannot visibly be seen.

    The standard Desirability view can help to a limited extent. This represents several variables including "Transient Aura" effects, but it doesn't directly depict the Park Effect as many ploppable lots provide.

    That's where you may find our mod useful, giving a new perspective to see how this important data is formed within a city. It can be used to make strategical city planning decisions for where zoning should take place, and also to identify the sources for where either the positive or negative Park Effect is emitted from.

    Note that this mod is a *visual representation* of the Parks Aura within each city tile. It doesn't modify or alter the strength of aura effects, or any aspect of the gameplay whatsoever.

    **Main Design Features**

    Extreme cogitation has been devoted into all modding aspects:

    - Proven verified accuracy in the data representation.
    - Distinct breakpoints allow the data to be seen clearly and precisely.
    - Blending between the green and neutral allows for a gradual transition of the aura magnitude.
    - Updated legend scale with distinguishable colors (and value ranges represented).
    - Neutral aura is shown as an opaque and contrasting white shade.
    - Subtle transparency which lets the terrain show through.
    - Landfills and other trash processing facilities are highlighted **yellow** in the panel map so they're visible.
    - RCI zones appear when the view is active.
    - Overrides the standard Garbage view.

    **The Data Distribution**

    As mentioned, extensive testing has been conducted to identify the breakpoint thresholds forming the scale.

    This was done through a methodical and progressional testing approach, incrementally narrowing down the possibilities until identifying where each range is distributed. This is important because it means the distributions of how colors are arranged is fully accurate to their true values.

    For representing the data, a **Color Ramp** scale is used.

    As follows:

    ![Color Scale Thinger.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_01/5e2dccbcf3fb5_ColorScaleThinger.png.4488f0ef529da90d445cd97a59864711.png)

    This forms how the Data View panel appears with the 9 breakpoints:

    ![Data View Panel.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_01/5e2dccc0952ad_DataViewPanel.png.ffc426c5eea9cc5061bed2845979f136.png)

    **Sample Pics**

    In addition to the above previews, here's a few samples from how the Parks Aura view appears in game:

    **Deuteranopia Version**

    **(For color blindness)**

    To help in consideration for people with Deuteranopia color blindness, we've created a version specially with an optimized color scale. This allows the full extent of the ranges to be seen in shades from dark yellow to dark blue, meaning they contrast distinctly to equally represent the Parks Aura data accurately.

    Here's the file to install in the same way (place in your Plugins folder *instead* of the main file):

    **[zz_Deuteranopia DataView - Cori's Parks Aura v1.0.dat](https://community.simtropolis.com/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=53930)** ![*:read:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_49.gif "*:read:")

    Open the spoiler below for a sample:

    Spoiler

    This is a simulated Deuteranopia preview using the [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/) tool:

    ![A - Parks Aura Deuteranopia Actual Preview.jpg](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_01/5e2dcfe8ed5bb_A-ParksAuraDeuteranopiaActualPreview.jpg.d264d4d0c3e078a3ffddcb36cc89724d.jpg)

    And here's a preview for what it appears for those with trichromatic color vision:

    ![B - Parks Aura Deuteranopia Simulated Preview.jpg](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2020_01/5e2dcfedea1bc_B-ParksAuraDeuteranopiaSimulatedPreview.jpg.630ae12aea88de95a17a538e2b73264c.jpg)

    (For those with Deuteranopia color blindness, these two images above should appear very similar, if not identical.)

    On a related note, we previously created a Data Views mod for Deuteranopia:

    As follows:

    Note: The included Garbage view there would conflict with this Parks Aura mod since it replaces that, and so it'd be a case of installing one or the other (not both of them).

    **Note on Maxis Parks**

    An observation from testing is how the Maxis Parks generate a high amount of aura. This is cumulative which means it builds up as more are located within a close vicinity. As such it means they're prone to producing the maximum extent of Park Effect that is shown as the top end *Lovely* side of the scale.

    For reference, here's a list of the data values:

    Spoiler

    M = **10** R = **10** Open Paved Area

    M = **20** R = **80** Ranger Station

    M = **25** R = **15** Small Plaza

    M = **25** R = **25** Medium Plaza

    M = **30** R = **15** Open Grass Area

    M = **30** R = **30** Basketball Court

    M = **30** R = **30** Tennis Court

    M = **30** R = **50** Soccer Field

    M = **30** R = **50** Softball Field

    M = **30** R = **60** Skateboard Park

    M = **35** R = **30** Large Plaza

    M = **40** R = **35** Community Garden (All 4)

    M = **40** R = **40** Gazebo

    M = **50** R = **15** Small Park Green

    M = **60** R = **15** Small Flower Garden

    M = **60** R = **15** Small Playground

    M = **60** R = **30** Medium Park Green

    M = **70** R = **30** Medium Flower Garden

    M = **75** R = **25** Medium Playground

    M = **75** R = **45** Large Park Green

    M = **80** R = **10** Beach

    M = **85** R = **45** Large Flower Garden

    (M = Magnitude R = Radius)

    With these strengths of effects and it's very easy to build a few Small, Medium, or Large classed parks and see how the coverage soon mounts up.

    **Additional Notes**

    **Aura Thresholds**

    The highest aura the game tracks is 166 and above, which is represented by the *Lovely* shade.

    Once the 100 threshold is attained, this is significant because it's the maximum usefulness for positive aura. As per what [@xxdita](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/13826-xxdita/) posted [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/26475-no-jobs-and-abandonment-due-to-commute-time/?do=findComment&comment=1723854), it's the most that RCI see as an aura growth cap (YIMBY factor).

    Quoting for reference:

    > On 09/01/2020 at 12:32 PM, xxdita said:
    >
    > This is the maximum amount of Park Effect that can influence any RCI type.

    **Color Layering**

    Due to the color ramp having a light opacity which depicts the data in a more elegant fashion, occasionally the *Yuck* color at the negative end will appear somewhat purple shaded when over water. This happens because the shades mix up with the added blue hues.

    Additionally the same applies for different [terrain mods](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/71750-coris-terrain-shoppe/) also. Any given terrain mod will alter the color on the playing area. The scale has been optimally designed for regular green and brownish terrain, however the layering may appear differently depending on each individual type of terrain.

    **Game Glitch Discovered: Phantom Aura**

    You may occasionally find how some Park Effect still persists from an unknown source. As per what [@Naomi57](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/780182-naomi57/) posted [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/26475-no-jobs-and-abandonment-due-to-commute-time/?do=findComment&comment=1723778), and [@xxdita](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/13826-xxdita/) also did [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/26475-no-jobs-and-abandonment-due-to-commute-time/?do=findComment&comment=1724205), it can be seen how the data is still shown even with nothing plopped to generate the effect.

    When bulldozing some lots which produce aura, we believe our mod is *revealing* how the game doesn't always fully tidy up the underlying data. In our own tests, it doesn't appear tied to any particular lot. Also any given lot may or may not produce the leftover incorrect Park Effect data.

    As a potential remedy, we suggest to run at least a full month of game time prior to bulldozing any park, especially on ones larger than 1 x 1 in size. Then save the game, bulldoze the lot, and run a few more days while watching our Parks Aura data view. Should the glitch appear, now exit without saving and come back to try again. Or better still, avoid bulldozing any parks! ![*:P](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_3.gif "*:P")

    This really is an area where it was never known about until having a tool to show it. Quite possibly this view might explain why sometimes there can be stalled development if the phantom aura is causing it to be. Making regular backups of one's cities is thoroughly recommended in any case.

    Again, just to emphasize how our mod doesn't alter any data, and only displays what the game already has calculated. This is all internally stored and presented from within the internal saved file.

    **Location of Garbage**

    Since we expect most people already effectively manage their garbage well, only the location of the trash facilities is displayed (highlighted **yellow**). Additionally, the Garbage *Graph* is more useful if needing to know how close to capacity one is, over the trends of time.

    **Special Thanks**

    To everyone who helped with testing and posting feedback from the [inherited development thread](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/26475-no-jobs-and-abandonment-due-to-commute-time/?do=findComment&comment=1723643), the scope and direction wouldn't have been achievable without your valuable input to assist.

    In particular, the meticulous testing carefully conducted by [@Naomi57](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/780182-naomi57/) with each posted beta version inspired this release to be possible.

    Thank you! ![*:)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_1.gif "*:&#41;")
