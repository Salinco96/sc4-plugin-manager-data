    This is a preliminary workaround for a game bug that I recently found thanks to another discovery by sumwonyuno, all of which is documented over at
    https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=8870.msg284035#msg284035. You should have at least some basic understanding of the inner workings of the simulator to make a sense of it.


    **Short summary:** due to a presumable rounding/arithmetic error, almost every IH lot in the game didn't offer any high wealth ($$$) jobs so far, while still creating demand for R$$$ residents
    though.


    This fix changes it so IH lots offer 12% $$$ jobs instead of the originally designed but missing 10% $$$ jobs, reducing $$ jobs by 2% to 78% at the same time so the sum remains 100%. 12% was the
    number that I found which is the closest to 10% and at which the error is gone.


    This also affects the demand for R$$ and R$$$ (through the industry census drive), only by the same small margin of +-2% of your IH population though. I don't think that effect would be noticed in
    any established city. What you should notice though with this fix is R$$$ sims finally working at IH lots.


    Apart from the IH, there are also three ploppable Maxis buildings affected by this bug; the Medical Clinic, the Solar Power Plant and the Nuclear Power Plant. I refer you to the SC4Devotion thread
    for those.


    I'd be glad to get your feedback. BATers and LOTers who design ploppable buildings should be aware of the fact that this game bug can potentially kill jobs at their creations, too. Please read the
    linked SC4Devotion thread till the end, you might have to test your buildings if they're affected.


    **Compatibility:** This mod is fully compatible with **toroca's Industry Quadrupler mod**
    ([https://www.simtropolis.com/STEX/details.cfm?id=21293](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=21293)) and **bones1's Industry Doubler**
    ([https://www.simtropolis.com/STEX/details.cfm?id=15758](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=15758)) since those two mods use different properties than mine. Their mods work directly
    on the building properties, whereas mine is on a higher level, controlling job distribution for the entire class of IH lots.


    If you use one of the jobs_xx files from **niloluiz's RCImulti-MODpack** ([https://www.simtropolis.com/STEX/details.cfm?id=22255](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=22255)), you don't
    need my mod because it's already fixed.


    I'll add more compatibility information as I learn about it.
