    The Enterprise was perhaps the most ground-breaking ride ever for it's time, setting a standard for a whole generation of amusement rides on it's debut in 1972 - with an overall look, and
    engineering technology that was years ahead of any competition.


    There are 23 "HUSS" Enterprise units in North America, and 4 in Australia, one of which is a travelling road model, the other two belonging to Luna Park Melbourne, Dreamworld and another under
    refurbishment.


    The lot is 3x2.


    Cost: 15002


    It can be found next to the Viper and the Cyclone in your parks menu.


    If you have any questions or problems, please refer to the "Enterprise Thrill Ride" thread in the BAT forums.


    Enjoy!
