    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the Commercial BATs by zero7, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion, encompassing a total of 19 downloads. After battling a
    number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these
    dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **may** receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and
    provide technical support for the pack.


    #### Dependencies
