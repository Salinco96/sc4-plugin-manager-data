    Contains the popular Parking Lot texture dependency by WalkingSnake (previously sc4jeeks). From the author:

    These textures were previously known under my old name, **Sc4jeeks**. By the help of BSC they have been updated to remedy the texture conflict reported on them.

    These textures are also known as **WalkingSnake Textures**. If you have used the old Sc4jeeks version, be sure to run Cleanitol with the enclosed file to remove the following outdatedfiles:
