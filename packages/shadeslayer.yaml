    It's finally here! SCAG Cargo Lots by ShadeSlayer (SCAG-CLSS) is a series of lots aimed to enhance the cargo aspect of SimCity Airports.


    There is a large update for this pack planned for April 2010. While game crashes are unlikely, we are going to remove that possibility and update dependencies. Thanks.


    SCAG-CLSS are purely eyecandy, and are not functional.


    Included with this package are the following:

      -  The plane/building lots;
      -  Some cargo props created by various members of SCAG (noted below);
      -  A readme file;
      -  A cleanitol dependency checker; and
      -  Some pictures to make it look pretty.

    All of this is contained in a .zip file. There is no EXE installer as to maintain cross-compatability between different Operating Systems.

    Sorry for the huge amount of dependencies, but I created this under the assumption that most users downloading this would already have airports, and thus, have about half of the dependencies
    already.

    Credits/Thanks

    This package was created by myself, with assistance with some fellow team members in the area of prop making, namely:


      - joelyboy911: Cargo Loaders


      - cameron1991: LD3 containers


      - RustyXL: LD3 carts


      - AC Team: for creating the plane models


    Also thanks to the SCAG team. Without them, this probably wouldn't have been as face-smashingly awesome.
