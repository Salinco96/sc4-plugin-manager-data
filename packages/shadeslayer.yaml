    About

    -----


    It's finally here! SCAG Cargo Lots by ShadeSlayer (SCAG\-CLSS) is a series of lots aimed to enhance the cargo aspect of SimCity Airports.


    _**There is a large update for this pack planned for April 2010. While game crashes are unlikely, we are going to remove that possibility and update dependencies. Thanks.**_


    SCAG\-CLSS are purely eyecandy, and are **not** functional.


    Included with this package are the following:


    1.  The plane/building lots;

    2.  Some cargo props created by various members of SCAG (noted below);

    3.  A readme file;

    4.  A cleanitol dependency checker; and

    5.  Some pictures to make it look pretty.


    All of this is contained in a .zip file. There is no EXE installer as to maintain cross-compatability between different Operating Systems.


    Installation Instructions

    -------------------------


    Unzip (extract) the .ZIP file into your "My Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins" folder.


    Dependencies

    ------------


    Sorry for the huge amount of dependencies, but I created this under the assumption that most users downloading this would already have airports, and thus, have about half of the dependencies
    already.

    --------------


    This package was created by myself, with assistance with some fellow team members in the area of prop making, namely:


    joelyboy911: Cargo Loaders


    cameron1991: LD3 containers


    RustyXL: LD3 carts


    AC Team: for creating the plane models


    Also thanks to the SCAG team. Without them, this probably wouldn't have been as face-smashingly awesome.
