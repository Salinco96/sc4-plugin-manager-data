    Maxis' Hang Glider is spawned by the Marina. As soon as you've built that reward you will have hang gliders all over your city.

    Whenever you want to take a snapshot for an upload or for a Mayor's Diary, you'd be certain to get one of those gliders in the middle of the picture.

    This mod blocks these hang gliders from appearing. Whenever you want them to appear again, just remove **RJ - Block Maxis Hangglider.dat** from your plugins.

    The Toilet Paper Tree is a deciduous tree prop made by Maxis.

    The same tree normally appears in the game without any toilet paper.

    However, if you allow crime to escalate, some of these trees will appear with toilet paper hanging from the branches.

    This mod simply replaces the toilet paper tree model in that prop with the standard model without toilet paper.

    You will not have to replop any trees, all existing toilet paper will disappear.

    The high wealth street lights were given very small light bulbs by Maxis.

    This means that the high wealth areas look darker at night than the rest of the city.

    (I guess they wouldn't be able to sleep otherwise...)

    This mod replaces those small light bulbs in all $$$ street lights with a light cone.

    This gives a better illuminated city at night.

    Especially if you are using Gizmo's **Day-Night Mod v2.0**!

        A patch for the Census Repository v3.5, to complete the tables with all information. Based off of the first Census Repository Patch and the SC4MoreDemandInfo DLL both by Null45.


        Thanks to Ripplejet & RaphaelNinja for the original Census Repository, and Null45 for the SC4MoreDemandInfo DLL and original Census Repository Patch. And also thanks to CorianaMaria for the
        Neutral Tax Override fix!


        This patch for the Census Repository fills out the entire table so that all information can be displayed. It now shows Regional Capacity as well as projected Regional Demand for all wealth
        levels of all zones, as well as totals for this information as well. It also fixes a typo in the original patch by Null45 to correctly display CS$ active demand, and like his patch, uses the
        game code to display I-Ag Cap Status.

    **Metasmurf** requested a mod that removes the wash effect which appears around the columns of bridges.There are four of them, but only two of them are used for the in-game bridges.

    This mod simply disables all four wash effects, blocking them from appearing. Whenever you want them to appear again,just remove **RJ - Disable Bridge Wash Effect 1.1.dat** from your plugins.

    Thank you **Metasmurf** for the in-game images to this upload!<

    Gizmo's **Day-Night Mod v2.0** makes the nights darker and longer.

    However, the night lights in the game are set to be lit between 20:00 and 01:00.

    After 1 am this means the cities will be pitch dark till dawn at 7 am.

    This mod extends the time the night lights are lit, to match the day/night cycle in Gizmo's mod.

    With this mod, the lights are lit between 18:00 and 07:00.
