    Maxis' Hang Glider is spawned by the Marina. As soon as you've built that reward you will have hang gliders all over your city.

    Whenever you want to take a snapshot for an upload or for a Mayor's Diary, you'd be certain to get one of those gliders in the middle of the picture.

    This mod blocks these hang gliders from appearing. Whenever you want them to appear again, just remove **RJ - Block Maxis Hangglider.dat** from your plugins.

    The black and yellow road barrier props appear at the end of all ordinary networks, Streets, Roads, One-Way Roads, Avenues and Highways. This little mod simply disables two small props, and
    removes all barriers on the fly.

    The Toilet Paper Tree is a deciduous tree prop made by Maxis.

    The same tree normally appears in the game without any toilet paper.

    However, if you allow crime to escalate, some of these trees will appear with toilet paper hanging from the branches.

    This mod simply replaces the toilet paper tree model in that prop with the standard model without toilet paper.

    You will not have to replop any trees, all existing toilet paper will disappear.

    The high wealth street lights were given very small light bulbs by Maxis.

    This means that the high wealth areas look darker at night than the rest of the city.

    (I guess they wouldn't be able to sleep otherwise...)

    This mod replaces those small light bulbs in all $$$ street lights with a light cone.

    This gives a better illuminated city at night.

    Especially if you are using Gizmo's **Day-Night Mod v2.0**!

    **Metasmurf** requested a mod that removes the wash effect which appears around the columns of bridges.There are four of them, but only two of them are used for the in-game bridges.

    This mod simply disables all four wash effects, blocking them from appearing. Whenever you want them to appear again,just remove **RJ - Disable Bridge Wash Effect 1.1.dat** from your plugins.

    Thank you **Metasmurf** for the in-game images to this upload!<

    Gizmo's **Day-Night Mod v2.0** makes the nights darker and longer.

    However, the night lights in the game are set to be lit between 20:00 and 01:00.

    After 1 am this means the cities will be pitch dark till dawn at 7 am.

    This mod extends the time the night lights are lit, to match the day/night cycle in Gizmo's mod.

    With this mod, the lights are lit between 18:00 and 07:00.
