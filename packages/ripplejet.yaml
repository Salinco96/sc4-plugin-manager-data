      description: |-
        After 16 years from the release of RippleJet's Census Repository Facility v3.5 (since October 26, 2008), the Census Repository has been upgraded to take advantage of modern DLL functionality now available for Simcity4. There are also numerous fixes, one of them critical and some others identified by RippleJet himself subsequent to the release of version 3.5, which are now incorporated into the Census Repository query along with some other new features. This readme has been revised to reflect the new fixes and features.
