    #### **SC4D LEX Legacy - Diggis Complete Ponds and Streams**


    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the complete set of the ponds and streams by Diggis, including Props and Lots, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion. After
    battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect
    these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    ### INSTALLATION:


    This package is a simple .zip file. Just extract the BSC folder to your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins directory (or equivalent, if you have a custom Plugins folder location).


    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins.


    ptionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective/master and separately all the individual cleanitol files and by using either the newer <ins>**[nos.17's SC4
    Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/)**</ins> or the older <ins>**BSC Cleanitol**</ins> tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these
    files.
