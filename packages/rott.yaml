    A plain old building supply warehouse in a now very run down part of Oakland, California.


    Figured we needed more nondescript industrial as fillers so I made this one. Because there isn't really a proper industrial designation for this type of thing we made it an I-M lot but modified
    the stats to reflect it more accurately of a warehouse found in an industrial area, pollutes way less and uses way less city resources than a typical I-M at the cost of having much less jobs and
    taking up more space than a typical larger industrial lot would (5 x 3 lot).


    Also, this is just the vanilla version, there is a much more decorated prop dependent version I'm working on I will release soon.


    Thanks [@sejr99999](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/279388-sejr99999/) for testing this
