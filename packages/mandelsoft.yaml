    Description

    The Light Replacement Mod (LRM) v4.0 Mega Pack consists of three parts: a prop pack, some plopable streetlights sets and a streetlight override mod.

    The first part, the prop pack, is essential for this mod. It contains 59 new streetlight designs and over 200 new props you can use for lots.

    The second part, the plopable streetlights sets, contains 31 sets of plopable streetlights for on the road sides and 20 sets for RHW medians. These can be used to enlighten your (Real) Highways.
    With lots of variation, there's plenty of choice for everyone!

    The third part, the streetlight override mod, contains overrides for all streetlights in-game, replacing the Maxis streetlights with custom designs. This will give your city an unique and
    characteristic look. There's a large variety of designs available in various styles. Want to make your cities look more American, European or Commie? No problem! You can even compose your own
    style, isn't that great?

    All streetlights in this pack also have a more uniform light spreading, making your cities not only looking great from up close, but also from further away. So what are you waiting for? Install
    some new lights and give your city a whole new look at day and night!

    There are no dependencies for this package, since it's a dependency by itself.
