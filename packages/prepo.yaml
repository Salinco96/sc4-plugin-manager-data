  description: |-
    Nasinneula Observation Tower. Origin: Tampere, Finland.

    2x2 size lot, cost $28000, maintain cost $89.

    The tallest (168 m) observation tower in the Nordic countries, opened in 1971. In real world, Nasinneula is a part of Sarkanniemi Amusement Park (I'm not going to model rest of that park).

    The entrance is not (yet) like original, i didn't find good photos, I might update later (there is actually a quite large building down there).
