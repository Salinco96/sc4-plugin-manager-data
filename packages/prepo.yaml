    Nasinneula Observation Tower. Origin: Tampere, Finland.

    2x2 size lot, cost $28000, maintain cost $89.

    The tallest (168 m) observation tower in the Nordic countries, opened in 1971. In real world, Nasinneula is a part of Sarkanniemi Amusement Park (I'm not going to model rest of that park).

    The entrance is not (yet) like original, i didn't find good photos, I might update later (there is actually a quite large building down there).

    Yeah, it's a library. I made this originally for SYM prod. chained university project but it never progressed much further.

    Lot is size 4x4, plop cost is $3500 and monthly cost is max. $1000. Gives jobs for 100 librarians I think. No dependencies.

    UPDATE: Version 1.01, updated the EQ boost stat, it's now closer to other library BATs on STEX.

    To install, unzip the file into your plugins directory.
