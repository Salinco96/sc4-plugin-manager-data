    This is a set of props you can add to your lots to aid the player in seeing how to orient the lot.

    Where needed, these will be used on Simpeg Team Projects, at the developers discretion.

    They are bright orange in color, and should be easily seen in the preview. They are timed to show up, only one day, in a game year (Jan 1st).
