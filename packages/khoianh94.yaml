    This Download contains 15 lots with several bus and tram stops for your city:


    - Five lots with normal bus stops just like the ones from Maxis, but with higher capacities. They base on two models: The first (made by khoianh) is available in three different colours while the
    second (made by Fluggi) comes as normal and diagonal version.

    - Four lots with bus stops which can be placed on roads. Three of them base on narrower versions of khoianh's normal bus stop models, the forth lot has a simple bench for areas with low
    congestion.

    - Six lots for the tramway (GLR) with the three narrow bus models and two lot sizes (2x1, 3x1) with different capacities.


    khoianh's Models and props are HD rendered to show the maximum amount of details.
