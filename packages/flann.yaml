    This mod replaces 7 of the original Maxis fences with brand new HD props by @Girafe. See screenshots for which fences are replaced. Great care was taken to create props which behave in the same
    way as the Maxis props in order to ensure a seamless override.


    There are three .dats in this download:


    Grfe-Maxis-Fence_Models.dat - Required


    Grfe-Maxis-Fence_Override-Exemplars.dat - Semi-required, overrides the Maxis props everywhere they are used.


    Grfe-Maxis-Fence_New-LE-Props.dat - Optional; contains non-override prop exemplars for use in the lot editor.


    Many thanks to Girafe for spending time creating these wonderful models, and to Tyberius for assistance in testing.


    Enjoy!
