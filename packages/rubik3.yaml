    **SC4D LEX Legacy - BSC Custodian Rubik WTC Complex**


    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the complete set of World Trade Center Compelex (Pre 11/9/2001) by Rubik, including Props and Lots, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at
    SC4 Devotion.


    It includes the contents of 7 previously separate downloads.


    After battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to
    collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    ### CONTENTS:


    - BSC MEGA Props Rubik3 Vol01 - WTC Props

    - BSC Rubik3 WTC Landmark

    - BSC Rubik3 WTC Placeholder

    - BSC Rubik3 WTC Reward

    - BSC WTC Submenu

    - One and Two World Trade - added with Version 2


    ### INSTALLATION:


    ***Please note: if you had any of the older versions of these contents (including the now added One and Two World Trade - came as: WTC_One World Trade.dat and WTC_Two World Trade.dat), first you
    must bulldoze them in your cities, then remove the original files from your Plugins.***


    This package is a simple .zip file.


    Copy/extract the ***BSC*** and ***CAM*** parent folders into your plugins (or equivalent, if you have a custom Plugins folder location). If you extracted the ~Documents folder into your plugins,
    too, it's highly recommended to keep it, but move it out of the Plugins folder.


    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins.


    ptionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective/master and separately all the individual cleanitol files and by using either the newer **[nos.17's SC4
    Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/)** or the older **BSC Cleanitol** tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.
