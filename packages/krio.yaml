    **Tennispalatsi** is the largest cinema complex in Finland with 14 auditoriums. Originally built for Helsinki Olympics in 1937, building was first turned into car showroom before Helsinki hosted
    olympics in 1952 and basketball games was played there. Tennis was played in newer Kisahalli. After the Olympics it was converted to department store and in 1993 it was converted to cinema complex
    with museums, restaurants and small movie-themed shops.


    In the SimCity it acts as static landmark. Despite the pictures, building has nightlights.

    **TG Autotalo** is a building from Helsinki, Finland.


    Two towers were built 1958 and were inspired by Lever House from Manhattan. During the years the complex grew to four towers, which don't share the looks of the original two and Autotalo now
    occupies whole city block in Kamppi. Besides offices building has several bars and nightclubs and restaurants, from lowly fast-food to one of the finest ones in Helsinki. Tenants in towers vary
    from small one people business to head offices of several hundreds of people; here you find offices of great Krioworks.


    If you want to recreate Helsinki in your SimCity, download [Tennispalatsi](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/27353-tennispalatsi/) and place it next to Autotalo.
