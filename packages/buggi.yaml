    These lots will allow the game to build some of the Stage 8 buildings on cities with a mostly 6 square wide grid. Usually the buildings were only available on 4 wide lots and hard to find in a 6-BY configuration.

    Also added are some other commercial buildings that were somewhat restricted to the 6-BY grid and now available for a 4 wide configuration (Brock Furnishings for example)

    This will allow for a more broad variety of buildings for your city.

    Enjoy :-)

    I have wanted to update the crime simulation in SC4 to reflect that of a more realistic model for awhile. There was simply TO MUCH crime in a city. The following mod address both the sim and the other desire to elimiate the problem all together.

    This file contains two separate options. NoCrime.dat updates the crime simulator to eliminate crime. This doesn't eliminate the need for your sims to feel "safe". So police stations are still useful.

    The other file is LowCrime.dat which dramatically reduces the amount of crime in your city as well as increasing the overall effectiveness of police stations in reducing crime.

  description: |-
    The SimCity 4 Extra Cheats Plugin was originally an internal SimCity 4 file, used by Maxis during the development phase to test the game before its release to the public. However, in the years following the release of the game, Buggi, a prominent modder resident here at Simtropolis, contacted Maxis and was given permission to release this file to the public.

    The extra cheats plugin adds many additional features to the game, such as the ability to plop any building or lot at will, the ability to easily set how much money is in your city's treasury and even the ability to add snow to your terrains, as well as many other additional functions.

    However, it should be kept in mind that this file was originally never intended to be released to the public. It was built for testing purposes only. As a result, it should be treated with caution. Using this file incorrectly can lead to game instability and even crashes. No guarantees or comprehensive user guides can be provided with this file, if you choose to use it, you must do so at your own risk.

    **How to use this file in the game:**

    After you install (see below), enter a city and press the key combination \[CTRL\] + \[x\] to open the cheat box. Right click anywhere within the cheat box, you will see a drop down list appear. You can now select a cheat from the list by clicking on it. After you have selected a cheat, press enter to confirm your selection.

    Below is a list of all known cheat codes enabled by this file (as well as the standard game cheats) and a description of their effects. As the effects of some cheats are unknown, not all cheats have available descriptions.

    ![ExtraCheats.png](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/attachments/monthly_2019_02/ExtraCheats.png.7f81cfd14dc2740e27142fa75d7ccee8.png)

    To fill in some unknowns Maxis has given me the details on a few of the missing descriptions.

    **Barstuck** \- Once invoked, all of your small commercial services (low-density 1x3 lots) start turning into coffee bars, and then they stay that way forever.

    **WatchMeMove** \- Enables animation stepping. After it is enabled, control-shift-alt-F11 and control-shift-alt-P implement animation stepping and pausing, respectively.

    **GP** &lt;on | off&gt; - Enables or disables game pause when you switch to another application. This is useful for if you go away from the game and you want it to sleep while it is in the background.

    **Flora** (on | off) | (preserve on | off) | (propogation on | off) | (blast &lt;splat_count&gt; &lt;per_splat_count&gt; &lt;splat radius&gt;)

    Controls flora simulation parameters. By default, during city play flora simulation is on, preservation is off, and propogation is off. Preservation refers to the keeping of trees on land when the land is developed. Propogation refers to the spreading of seeds and automatic creation of new flora life in the city.

    Example(s)

    Flora on

    Flora preserve off

    Flora propogation on

    Flora blast 5 8 60

    This set is similar to the Commercial 6BY Collection in that it gives a wider range of buildings to be built on many zoning styles.

    This set edits all THREE wealth levels of Residental. It not only add function to those 4x4 buildings such as Ong Condos, but also a couple other buildings that were previously restricted to 2 or 3 squares.

    Overall gives the game a much broader range of buildings to use while developing your city.

    Screenshots are of Project Bootstrap and the Byall Tower.

    No story with this mod. This is the first Radical mod I've done for mainstream release.

    Please do not use this mod if you want your city to grow and develop as the original game would allow. This mod is designed to do one thing, and that's to allow your city to grow at an exponential rate.

    Modified all Commercial Service, Commercial Office and Industrial zone demand to skyrocket to 500% of what it was.
