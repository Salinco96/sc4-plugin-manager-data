    These are ***as-is*** models. They're good enough for me so they will have to be good enough for you ![;)](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaWink.gif ";&#41;")


    I've been busy with IRL stuff lately so I haven't had time to complete these in any sort of "final" manner with proper detailing, nightlights etc, but anyway here are some high rise structures for
    FA2 angled roadways.


    Download includes both mirrored versions of the following lots w/overhanging prop:


    **FA2 Citysphere** (*801 King St, Toronto, ON*) // LM 2x2


    **FA2 Cocoa Exchange** (*1 Wall Street, New York, NY*) // LM 1x2


    **FA2 Rhodes Haverty** (*127 Peachtree St, Atlanta, GA*) // LM 1x2


    **FA2 TD Bank** (*Cadman Plaza, Brooklyn, NY*) // LM 3x3


    No dependencies, no refunds or exchanges. No shoes, no shirt, NO service. No pets (service animals allowed)

    Break the grid!!!

    This is a flatiron-type building for the intersection of an ortho network and the FA2 road. It's based on a residential building on the south end of Bradhurst Ave in Harlem, NYC.

    Download includes: 2 recolors, left and right rotations. 1x1 landmark lots (overhanging props occupy ~1x3)

    No lights this time. Flood the comments with your complaints lol

    Productive approach: hit me up with better ways to do nightlighting. I do it by adding "nite_" manually to each individual window pane and it is painstaking. Tips welcome

        FA2 The Bradhurst Growify lots


        By Kel9505


        Based off of EffTheGrid's model: FA2 The Bradhurst.


        Included are two FA2 lots based off of EffTheGrid's original lots and models. They have been transformed into ploppable R$$ Residential lots that can be used in the game if Growifed with the
        growify DLL mod by Null45.


        These are LOTS ONLY, and do not include the models. These are new lots and do not overwrite EffTheGrid's original landmark eyecandy lots. They are rotated slightly differently than
        EffTheGrid's original lots (but appear the same), in order to provide better access to the street. The building will not appear until plopped.


        Note: This mod requires DLL dependencies by Null45. DLL Dependencies are ONLY available for version 1.1.641 of SimCity 4 (Windows Digital Copies). All dependencies listed below are REQUIRED
        for this RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod to work. For more information about compatible versions of Simcity4 and DLL mods, see here:


        https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/762980-the-future-of-sc4-modding-the-matter-of-digital-vs-disc-and-windows-vs-macos-in-the-dll-era/


        REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES:


        1\. [FA2 The Bradhurst](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/34599-fa2-the-bradhurst/), by EffTheGrid:


        2\. [Growify DLL Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36180-growify-plopped-buildings-cheat-dll-plugin/), by Null45:


        TO INSTALL:


        Make sure Simcity4 is not running prior to installation.


        Extract all files into your Simcity4 Plugins folder. The archive can be extracted into a subfolder containing EffTheGrid's models and original lots.


        TO USE:


        Pause the game, plop the lots along a FA2 street with an orthogonal street on the alternate side (the lot pointing to the orthogonal street), use the Growify cheat code "Growify R M" or
        "Growify R H" to growify the lots as medium density or high density lots. Make sure they have water and power or, like any other lot, they may abandon.


        Stats:


        All buildings: R$$ 285 residents.

    First of all I should mention these are not my models: they were made (with exhaustive attention to detail) by [@EffTheGrid](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/402017-effthegrid/) some
    years ago. **I have not changed anything** on these, my only contributions here are adding nightlights (in MaxisNite or DarkNite—use only one), mirroring the recolor, and of course re-exporting in
    high definition to show off FTG's work more fully.


    Mostly the lots are the reason I'm uploading this: recent weeks have seen increasing uploads of Fractional Angle content, [@Null 45](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/246111-null-45/)'s
    Growify mod, and now [@Kel9509](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/817829-kel9509/)'s Ploppable Residentials config. While I have some ideas for fractionally angled content of my own I
    could contribute, I figured it would be a good idea to share these as well. All credit goes to FTG.


    This is a real building not far from where I live, depicted here by FTG as it looked in 2020 (Anthony's Deli has since expanded and now has an exciting animated sign which I completely failed to
    replicate; the building has also been repainted and renovated and thus no longer has its white rear walls). It is a mixed-use building with the residential apartments known as 3505 Wayne Avenue
    while the ground floor businesses are 169 to 181 East Gun Hill Road. The recolored mirror version as far as I know comes from FTG's imagination. It comes to SimCity in the following formats:


    - Ploppable medium-wealth commercial services buildings with 169 jobs

    - Ploppable medium-wealth residential buildings with 295 residents (requires Growify)


    Each format is provided with two lots: 2x2 (standard) and 2x1 (overhanging, set back 10.64m) to fit different positions along a FA\-3 network. As there is an alleyway behind the building, a rare
    phenomenon in New York, the 2x1 version allows you to fill it with the alley style of your choice. I didn't produce a 5.32m setback version, as on the other side of the alleyway is a house that's
    almost exactly 5.32 meters wide and which I figured I should BAT for the sake of realism, but have yet to get around to. It may or may not happen one of these days.

    Dependencies: Technically, none. However: Fractional Angle networks require [the Network Addon Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26793-network-addon-mod-nam-cross-platform/).
    DarkNite requires [Simfox Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/). Plopped residential buildings will abandon unless growified with [Null
    45's Growify](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36180-growify-plopped-buildings-cheat-dll-plugin/). I've heard that residential ploppables can be more easily accessed if you have
    [memo's Submenus DLL](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36142-submenus-dll/) although I haven't tried it myself.

        By Kel9505


        Based off of EffTheGrid's model: FA3 559 Anderson Ave (Residential).


        Included are two FA3 lots based off of EffTheGrid's original lot and model. It has been transformed into a ploppable R$ Residential lot that can be used in the game if Growifed with the
        growify DLL mod by Null45.


        These are LOTS ONLY, and does not include the model. These are new lots and do not overwrite EffTheGrid's original landmark eyecandy lots.


        Note: This mod requires DLL dependencies by Null45. DLL Dependencies are ONLY available for version 1.1.641 of SimCity 4 (Windows Digital Copies). All dependencies listed below are REQUIRED
        for this RCI DLL Query Upgrade Mod to work. For more information about compatible versions of Simcity4 and DLL mods, see here:

        TO USE:


        Pause the game, plop the lot along a FA3 street (the lot pointing to the FA3 street), use the Growify cheat code "Growify R M" or "Growify R H" to growify the lot as medium density or high
        density lots. Make sure it has water and power or, like any other lot, it may abandon. If you have the submenu DLL mod by memo, the lots will appear in the Residential Zone menu under R$
        Ploppables.

    BREAK THE GRID! THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX!

    Another eyecandy lot for your FAR\-3 networks. This is an ortho corner

    2x1 ploppaple landmark

    I think this is the first building in Yonkers when you leave the Bronx on Broadway. IRL it's a residential building with a bodega and some businesses

    No nightlighting, and I'd love to improve the stats on these. (lesser plop cost)

        Based off of EffTheGrid's model: FA3 928 S Broadway.


        Included is one FA3 lot based off of EffTheGrid's original lot and model. It has been transformed into a ploppable R$ Residential lot that can be used in the game if Growifed with the growify
        DLL mod by Null45.


        This is a LOT ONLY, and does not include the model. This is a new lot and does not overwrite EffTheGrid's original landmark eyecandy lot. It is rotated slightly differently than EffTheGrid's
        original lot (but appears the same), in order to provide better access to the street.
