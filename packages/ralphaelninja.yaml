    This modd reduces crime to a level that is controllable and if required can almost eliminate crime entirely by placing a squadron of police station.

    This is one of those easy modd that should have been done back in the first days of modding but no one got around to it. In our rush to do the impossible we overlook some of the simpler modds. Although fairly simple, a day was spent in testing the various effects of the changes so as not to remove crime entirely. This modd should satisfy the purist and if not, it should satisfy the not so pure. Enjoy...
