    This is a large elementary school using Xannepan's JENX building. Nothing special.


    Plop - $5000


    Bulldoze - $1000


    Monthly - $500


    Capacity - 2000 students


    Radius of small map with double the EQ of regular school.


    I think it fits into growing cities well and use it to get larger cities growing quickly. Thanks to Xannepan for the wonderful building. This is a stand alone lot with no outside dependencies.
    Enjoy!

    This is my first attempt at a SimMars building. It is a martian version of the Black Hole Enterprises called the Red Hole Water Pump. It is a pump and filtration system.

    Plop - $750

    Doze - $500

    Monthly - $250

    Water produced and filtered - 100,000

    As always, the red glow is back at night. The textures may change to fit into the game better. There are no dependencies. Enjoy and please comment, I am making more and the feedback helps.
