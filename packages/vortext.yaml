    This is a set of 42 new base textures for use in the Lot Editor. Included in the download are two files, namely:


    Vortexture 1 - BaseSet v1.dat ; the file which contains the actual textures


    Vortexture 1 - demo.SC4Lot ; a lot with all 42 base textures - you will find this in the ~Documents/TEST_LOT folder


    A note to LOTters


    You may be accustomed to rotating and/or mirroring base textures in the Lot editor in order to circumvent repetitive tiling effects. This practice is not necessary with the current set, and may in
    fact give unsatisfactory results, because all base textures are so-called multi-fsh textures. This means each texture holds multiple variations of itself, and the game will randomly pick a
    variation to display. Please note, however, the variations do not show up in the Lot Editor.


    *Disclaimer*


    Textures are released as is and will most likely be subject to further tweaking in the future.


    Corresponding sets of overlay textures are forthcoming as well. If you want to stay up to date on progress please visit my thread, which is also the placeto be if you have questions and/or remarks
    otherwise.


    **Vortexture 2 - Grass & Dirt v2**


    This download contains various sets of overlay and two-toned base textures based on the previously released set of base textures, for use in the Lot Editor. Included are:


    6 sets of grass overlays, 48 shapes per set


    6 sets of dirts overlays, 48 shapes per set


    5 sets of unpaved overlays, 32 shapes per set


    8 sets of two-tone base textures, 48 shapes per set


    As always textures are released - as is - and may be subject to further tweaking in the future.
