    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the Japanese River Project (JRP) canal set by MAS71 (including the Suburban Canal Set and MAS71 MEGA Props Vol 02), which had been available on the Lot
    Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion. After battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023,
    and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    ### **CREDITS:**


    The following members contributed models, textures, and modding support to this collection:


    - MAS71


    This package has been made possible by the Project ZIP efforts of Tyberius06, and was assembled by Tarkus.


    ##### Special Thanks


    Webmaster & administration staff at SC4 Devotion.


    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)


    #### Contents


    This package contains the following former LEX downloads:

    Various pieces of original documentation (in both English and Japanese) and earlier Cleanitol definitions can be found in the "~Documents" folder, which, while installed in the Plugins directory,
    should be removed.
