    **Justanothersim High School**


    Chalk full of moldy old books and leaky celings, this demoralizing building is supposed to teach your teenage sims. Rather large and of old 1920's design, its perfect for your cities. Just needs
    to be ridden of esbestos and other "harmful" substances. But the school administration doesn't care, they just want a big screen television in the staff room. Good eq booster and school coverage
    radius.


    Stats unavaliable till later due to "computer problems". To explain it more, my internet and network connections "disappeared" and was forced to save this to a memory card and bring to another
    computer. My computer will likely be cleared of all files and I needed to save the files. This computer does not have SC4 or BAT, but I managed to try it out on my busted computer before things
    got worse. My deep apologies.
