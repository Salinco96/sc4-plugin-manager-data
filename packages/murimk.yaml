    There were these two guys with a faible for bicycles, dreaming how good it would be to have bikes roaming all over the sim-planet... better air, fewer fat people, new business opportunities... So
    they put together their meager resources, leased a run down warehouse, started deforming metal... and built an empire!

    Others

    Works like a real school, but for a limited number of students - so don't try to skimp on the rest of your education program...


    All other stats like power, water, monthly costs etc. are indicated via the ingame menu.


    The 'IND and COM' lots are in the 'Landmarks' menu.


    The various 'Parking' lots are in the 'Traffic | Miscellaneous' menu.


    The 'Traffic Kindergarten' is in the 'Education' menu.


    They all have custom icons for easy identification.


    DEPENDENCIES


    * PEG MTP SUPER PACK


    * BSC MEGA Props - SG Vol 01


    Additional (for the industrial lots)


    * PEG Security Fencing Kit


    * PEG Rail-Fleet RESOURCE


    It is assumed that you have * bldgprop vol1 and vol2 installed as well.


    DEVELOPER NOTES


    Many of the lots come in two flavors - urban and rural. You can use the sets together or just one of them. This goes for all the included lots - delete any you do not wish to use.


    Just make sure you always keep the complete folder named *PAMU-Bikes_Resource* installed.


    More detailed infos -e.g. on benefits, randomized and timed props etc.- in the included Read_Me.


    RECOMMENDATION


    To add bikes outside of the designated lots we recommended this set of major mode ploppables (optional):


    * Bikes by NBVC

      -  Bikes (7 different colors)

    NOTE: Props only - this package does not include any lots!

    Murimk Prop Pack Vol03 - Industrials


    Here is a prop pack containing more than 300 small and large props, designed to create great versatility in lotting and designing industry themed lots and sets. Included is a large range of
    different industrial... stuff ;-)


    LIST OF ITEMS


    * Small Props - pallets, barrels, drums, hollow blocks, pipes, petrol tanks, girders, tires, cable drums, safety gear, trash containers, wooden fences - and more


    * Large Props - sheds, garages, mobile offices, tents and warehouses


    * Offset Props - short, long and diagonal offsets


    * Industrial Fences - puzzle pieces of different sizes, orientations and offsets


    * Filler Props (Dirt & Grunge Texture)


    * Extender Props (Dirt & Grunge Texture)


    Aldo included -


    * 6 MMP sequences - containing most of the small props


    DEPENDENCIES


    None!


    DEVELOPER NOTES


    * All props from this pack can be used to make your own lots. Do not include them in your upload though - please point to this pack as a dependency.


    * The props all have reduced bounding boxes (occupant size), to ensure maximum MMP 'paintability'.


    * There are no XML files included in this pack, as most of these props are designed to be overhanging, and therefore should not be made into building exemplars. If you do wish to make them into
    something other than props, you can fabricate exemplars in Reader, and refer them to the model in question (RKT1).


    * Most of the small and large props come in many variations -


    * orthogonal


    * diagonal


    * angled


    * offset


    * different colors


    * The MMPs are divided into six groups -


    1: Blue Drums, Barrels, Water- and Petrol Tank


    2: Pallets, Pallet Bins, Hollow Blocks, Cement Bags


    3: Iron Girders, Concrete- and PVC-Pipes


    4: Electric Cables, Cable Drums, Propane Cylinders


    5: Tires, Safety Items, Concrete Barriers


    6: Mobile Office Waggons and Tents, Trash Container


    * Find them at or near the end of the Mayor Menu with custom icons.


    * All MMP sequences have a blind prop at the end.


    * The MMPs are stored in a separate folder, and they are not packed together. That way, you can choose to omit any sequences you don't want in your game, to save menu space.


    [box]Note: This Pack includes NO Lots![/box]


    INSTALLATION


    Unpack into the plugins folder (in 'My Documents').


    All new props are packed into a resource dat. The lots are unpacked and kept in two different subfolders.


    If you wish to use only some of the lots, just remove the unwanted lots from your plugin folder.


    CREDITS


    Although all props are batted by Murimk, this has really been a team project with efforts, input and brainstorming from the Nightowls: Paeng, Shokthrpy, Epicblunder and Craig-Abcvs.


    The MMPs were modded by Epicblunder, Shokthrpy and Paeng.
