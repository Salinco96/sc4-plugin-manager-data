  description: >-
    There were these two guys with a faible for bicycles, dreaming how good it would be to have bikes roaming all over the sim-planet... better air, fewer fat people, new business opportunities... So
    they put together their meager resources, leased a run down warehouse, started deforming metal... and built an empire!


    **LOTS**


    **Industrials** (plop)


    \* 5x3 PAMU Metalworks (Shelters, Stands etc.) - 74 I-M jobs

    **Commercials** (plop)


    \* 4x3 PAMU Headquarters - 42 CS$$ jobs

    \* 2x2 Combined Car/Bike Parking - Capacity: 400


    The traffic switch is still from car to ped - but at least it \*looks\* as if some are arriving with their bikes, too...


    **Others**


    \* 6x6 PAMU Traffic Kindergarten and Bike Training - Capacity: 50


    Works like a real school, but for a limited number of students - so don't try to skimp on the rest of your education program...


    All other stats like power, water, monthly costs etc. are indicated via the ingame menu.


    The 'IND and COM' lots are in the 'Landmarks' menu.


    The various 'Parking' lots are in the 'Traffic | Miscellaneous' menu.


    The 'Traffic Kindergarten' is in the 'Education' menu.


    They all have custom icons for easy identification.


    **DEPENDENCIES**


    \* [PEG MTP SUPER PACK](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20966-peg-mtp-super-pack/)


    \* [BSC MEGA Props - SG Vol 01](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/15287-bsc-mega-props-sg-vol-01/)


    *Additional (for the industrial lots)*


    \* [PEG Security Fencing Kit](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/19338-peg-security-fencing-kit/)


    \* [PEG Rail-Fleet RESOURCE](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/19786-peg-cdk3-sp-rail-fleet/)


    It is assumed that you have \* bldgprop vol1 and vol2 installed as well.


    **DEVELOPER NOTES**


    Many of the lots come in two flavors - urban and rural. You can use the sets together or just one of them. This goes for all the included lots - delete any you do not wish to use.


    **Just make sure you always keep the complete folder named \*PAMU-Bikes_Resource\* installed.**


    More detailed infos -e.g. on benefits, randomized and timed props etc.- in the included Read_Me.


    **RECOMMENDATION**


    To add bikes outside of the designated lots we recommended this set of major mode ploppables (optional):


    \* [Bikes by NBVC](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/24859-bikes/)


    **CREDITS**


    BATting: **Murimk**


    LOTting and MODding: **Paeng**

    **Murimk Bicycle Props**


    For all who wish to introduce biycle-related items to their cities, here is the prop pack just for you. It is organized in different packages containing the following:


    - Bikes (7 different colors)

    - Bikers (straight and diagonal, in 7 different colors - timed to appear/disappear at certain times of the day)

    - Stands (with varying number of bikes)

    - Shop Stands (with advertisement and varying number of bikes)

    - Bike Shelters (2 types, with various colors)

    - Shop Signs (2 variations)


    In addition to the single props you'll also find prop-families for most items, as well as a MayorMode Ploppable (MMP) set for the bikers.


    All props are named with the prefix 'MUR' to easily locate them in LE.


    The props from this pack can be used to make your own lots. Do not include them in your upload though - please point to this pack as a dependency.


    ***NOTE: Props only - this package does not include any lots!***


    (There is a test-lot in the ReadMe folder for preview purposes only - you can safely delete it).


    This is a standalone version of the props used for [PAMU Bikes Inc.](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/25433-pamu-bikes-inc/) - if you have that set, you don't need this pack. The only
    difference is the included MMP set.


    If you already have 'PAMU-Bikes' installed but want the MMP set: Download this pack, get the **Bikers_MMP.dat** file from the subfolder called 'Bikers' and put in the PAMU folder located in your
    plugins folder.

    **Murimk Props Vol02**

    ***Last update: September 2011***

    *Parks, fences, graffiti and more*

    This is my second set of props (the first one beeing 'Murimk Bicycle Props v01').

    This pack contains various prop sets for lotting purposes.

    - Park Props (large and small set)
    - Park Fences (tiles and puzzle set)
    - Industrial Walls
    - Graffitis

    Please see a complete listing and description in the individual text files for every subset!

    \------------------------------------------------

    **DEVELOPER NOTES**

    \------------------------------------------------

    All props from this pack can be used to make your own lots. Do not include them in your upload though - please point to this pack as a dependency.

    Each set is packed in its own subset, so you can choose which part you want to use.

    If you only use part of the pack for a lot, point out the utilized subset(s) in your description, so the player as well may choose which parts of this pack to install.

    The folder 'Documentation' contains -

    - ReadMe files for each subset
    - images for each subset
    - a suite of testlots (for previewing only!)

    Store the complete 'Documentation' outside your 'Plugins' for future reference.

    **DEPENDENCIES**


    None! ![:thumb:](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/LlamaThumb.gif)


    **DEVELOPER NOTES**


    \* All props from this pack can be used to make your own lots. Do not include them in your upload though - please point to this pack as a dependency.


    \* The props all have reduced bounding boxes (occupant size), to ensure maximum MMP 'paintability'.


    \* There are no XML files included in this pack, as most of these props are designed to be overhanging, and therefore should not be made into building exemplars. If you do wish to make them into
    something other than props, you can fabricate exemplars in Reader, and refer them to the model in question (RKT1).


    \* Most of the small and large props come in many variations -


    \* orthogonal


    \* diagonal


    \* angled


    \* offset


    \* different colors


    \* The MMPs are divided into six groups -


    1: Blue Drums, Barrels, Water- and Petrol Tank


    2: Pallets, Pallet Bins, Hollow Blocks, Cement Bags


    3: Iron Girders, Concrete- and PVC-Pipes


    4: Electric Cables, Cable Drums, Propane Cylinders


    5: Tires, Safety Items, Concrete Barriers


    6: Mobile Office Waggons and Tents, Trash Container


    \* Find them at or near the end of the Mayor Menu with custom icons.


    \* All MMP sequences have a blind prop at the end.


    \* The MMPs are stored in a separate folder, and they are not packed together. That way, you can choose to omit any sequences you don't want in your game, to save menu space.


    \[box\]Note: This Pack includes NO Lots!\[/box\]


    **INSTALLATION**


    Unpack into the plugins folder (in 'My Documents').


    All new props are packed into a resource dat. The lots are unpacked and kept in two different subfolders.


    If you wish to use only some of the lots, just remove the unwanted lots from your plugin folder.


    **CREDITS**


    Although all props are batted by **Murimk**, this has really been a team project with efforts, input and brainstorming from the Nightowls: **Paeng**, **Shokthrpy**, **Epicblunder** and
    **Craig-Abcvs**.


    The MMPs were modded by **Epicblunder**, **Shokthrpy** and **Paeng**.
