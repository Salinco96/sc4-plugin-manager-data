    There were these two guys with a faible for bicycles, dreaming how good it would be to have bikes roaming all over the sim-planet... better air, fewer fat people, new business opportunities... So
    they put together their meager resources, leased a run down warehouse, started deforming metal... and built an empire!

    Others


    * 6x6 PAMU Traffic Kindergarten and Bike Training - Capacity: 50


    Works like a real school, but for a limited number of students - so don't try to skimp on the rest of your education program...


    All other stats like power, water, monthly costs etc. are indicated via the ingame menu.


    The 'IND and COM' lots are in the 'Landmarks' menu.


    The various 'Parking' lots are in the 'Traffic | Miscellaneous' menu.


    The 'Traffic Kindergarten' is in the 'Education' menu.


    They all have custom icons for easy identification.


    DEPENDENCIES


    * PEG MTP SUPER PACK


    * BSC MEGA Props - SG Vol 01


    Additional (for the industrial lots)


    * PEG Security Fencing Kit


    * PEG Rail-Fleet RESOURCE


    It is assumed that you have * bldgprop vol1 and vol2 installed as well.


    DEVELOPER NOTES


    Many of the lots come in two flavors - urban and rural. You can use the sets together or just one of them. This goes for all the included lots - delete any you do not wish to use.


    Just make sure you always keep the complete folder named *PAMU-Bikes_Resource* installed.


    More detailed infos -e.g. on benefits, randomized and timed props etc.- in the included Read_Me.


    RECOMMENDATION


    To add bikes outside of the designated lots we recommended this set of major mode ploppables (optional):


    * Bikes by NBVC

    Murimk Bicycle Props


    For all who wish to introduce biycle-related items to their cities, here is the prop pack just for you. It is organized in different packages containing the following:

      -  Bikes (7 different colors)
      -  Bikers (straight and diagonal, in 7 different colors - timed to appear/disappear at certain times of the day)
      -  Stands (with varying number of bikes)
      -  Shop Stands (with advertisement and varying number of bikes)
      -  Bike Shelters (2 types, with various colors)
      -  Shop Signs (2 variations)

    In addition to the single props you'll also find prop-families for most items.


    All props are named with the prefix 'MUR' to easily locate them in LE.


    The props from this pack can be used to make your own lots. Do not include them in your upload though - please point to this pack as a dependency.


    NOTE: Props only - this package does not include any lots!
