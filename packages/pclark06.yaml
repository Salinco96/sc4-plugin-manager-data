    Mega props 3. Mostly signs, some for future releases.

    I call this the sign update because there are 300+ new sign props in this zip. I'll probably update this with more Asian-based brands in the future.

    A new Mega Prop Pack, the highlight being about 1200 new car props. A lot of them are upsized versions of my older car props to fit the SHK Parking Pack, as well as added ground shadows. I also
    added some modern cars as well as some new pre-2000 cars. There is a list of all the new car props in the ZIP file. I made many of these cars to complement
    [@art128](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/183035-art128/)'s Pre-2000 Car Prop pack, as well as [@Barroco Hispano](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/415633-barroco-hispano/)'s AGC
    DLC.


    **4.1**


    Adds 2500 more car props of mostly racing cars.


    Includes:


    NASCAR 1980-present


    Indycar 1995-present


    BTCC/Super Touring Era 1980-2005


    V8 Supercars/Aussie TCC 1980-2018


    Some Formula 1 cars


    WRC 1980-2017


    More non-racing cars in various colors


    Thanks to the NR2003 community like [CC#48](https://www.nnracing.com/info.asp?userid=9576), [jopajoe](https://stunodracing.net/index.php?resources/authors/jopajoe.120/), [Brian
    Booth](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/nascarfunfacts/), all of [Stunod Racing,](http://stunodracing.net/index.php) for originally making these real-life race car designs. The intention is not to
    profit obviously, it is to have these cars available for the SimCity 4 community to create racing scenes for our cities.

    **This is not an April Fool's joke.** I have made some new global brands for the MGB Convenience store. I felt like it would be the right time to revisit the modular nature of
    [@rsc204](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/651629-rsc204/)'s model and the props to go along with it, and create additional stores from areas around the world that had not been covered by
    that. These don't use prop families, nor do they overlap with the original props for this, since over the years I have made unique props for these brands and figured, why not use them for this
    project? Each are in individual growable 4x4 lots. They are all separated by region, and you can choose which folders you want to use, or if you like a chaotic, global region, use all of them (be
    my guest!). If you want to plop these lots, use the LotPlop cheat from the [Extra Cheats DLL](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/). Also many of the
    gas canopies used are by [@RRetail](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/744613-rretail/) and were of great help for this project so special thanks to him for making them!

    Similar to the Australian retail set I did, I wanted to use the same base building to create some regional American supermarkets around this size. Grocery stores nowadays are massive but the base
    building goes back to a time when these stores were much smaller, and which, many still exist whether a pharmacy is using that space, or whether it's a smaller regional grocery chain that prides
    itself on customer service. Some of the buildings are smaller scale retailers in larger urban areas, and the grow lots can be utilized in a corner W2W space. These buildings fill in the gaps of
    the national retailers on the side. There are 90 buildings in total.


    If you use lotplop, you can access all these as plop buildings. Grow lots are 3x6 and plop lots are 7x6.

    Similar to the Australian retail set I did, I wanted to use the same base building to create some regional American supermarkets around this size. Grocery stores nowadays are massive but the base
    building goes back to a time when these stores were much smaller, and which, many still exist whether a pharmacy is using that space, or whether it's a smaller regional grocery chain that prides
    itself on customer service. These are retro brands that are either defunct, or have few locations remaining after mergers. There are 30 classic grocery stores in this set.


    If you use lotplop, you can access all these as plop buildings. Grow lots are 3x6 and plop lots are 7x6.

    Plots 10-12 of my office buildings that I made from 2022-23. I just never got around to releasing the rest of the buildings. These are one floor versions (others I have released are two floors).


    27 office buildings, with 9 in each "office plot," for suburban areas. Inspired by the endless amounts of office buildings that often have no deviation on one another in N. America. These are all
    stage 2 3x2 commercial offices with 8 or so different brands on each one. Can be used with [LotPlop](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/) for office
    parks or can be built individually/grown. Often these buildings are used for branch offices outside of main headquarters for various reasons.


    The readme is a list of the companies on these buildings.

    "A set of branded signs as commonly seen from the interstate, especially in many rural and suburban highway exits. Personally I use the hotel brands with @RebaLynnTS's Modular Motel
    System, and pair them with @kingofsimcity's modular parking that use @shokthrpy's parking pack textures, hence why the hotel brands have a pavement texture instead of a grass texture. I also have
    the lots and props in separate folders in case you don't want to use the lots, considering they do add a bunch of entries to the parks menu in-game. Dependencies: PC Mega Props Vol. 1 SHK Parking
