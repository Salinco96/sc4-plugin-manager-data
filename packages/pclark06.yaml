    Mega props 3. Mostly signs, some for future releases.

    I call this the sign update because there are 300+ new sign props in this zip. I'll probably update this with more Asian-based brands in the future.

    **This is not an April Fool's joke.** I have made some new global brands for the MGB Convenience store. I felt like it would be the right time to revisit the modular nature of
    [@rsc204](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/651629-rsc204/)'s model and the props to go along with it, and create additional stores from areas around the world that had not been covered by
    that. These don't use prop families, nor do they overlap with the original props for this, since over the years I have made unique props for these brands and figured, why not use them for this
    project? Each are in individual growable 4x4 lots. They are all separated by region, and you can choose which folders you want to use, or if you like a chaotic, global region, use all of them (be
    my guest!). If you want to plop these lots, use the LotPlop cheat from the [Extra Cheats DLL](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/). Also many of the
    gas canopies used are by [@RRetail](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/744613-rretail/) and were of great help for this project so special thanks to him for making them!

    This is not an April Fool's joke. I have made some new global brands for the MGB Convenience store. I felt like it would be the right time to revisit the modular nature of @rsc204's model
    and the props to go along with it, and create additional stores from areas around the world that had not been covered by that. These don't use prop families, nor do they overlap with the original
    props for this, since over the years I have made unique props for these brands and figured, why not use them for this project? Each are in individual growable 4x4 lots. They are all separated by
    region, and you can choose which folders you want to use, or if you like a chaotic, global region, use all of them (be my guest!). If you want to plop these lots, use the LotPlop cheat from the

  description: >-
    Similar to the Australian retail set I did, I wanted to use the same base building to create some regional American supermarkets around this size. Grocery stores nowadays are massive but the base
    building goes back to a time when these stores were much smaller, and which, many still exist whether a pharmacy is using that space, or whether it's a smaller regional grocery chain that prides
    itself on customer service. Some of the buildings are smaller scale retailers in larger urban areas, and the grow lots can be utilized in a corner W2W space. These buildings fill in the gaps of
    the national retailers on the side. There are 90 buildings in total.


    If you use lotplop, you can access all these as plop buildings. Grow lots are 3x6 and plop lots are 7x6.

    Similar to the Australian retail set I did, I wanted to use the same base building to create some regional American supermarkets around this size. Grocery stores nowadays are massive but the base
    building goes back to a time when these stores were much smaller, and which, many still exist whether a pharmacy is using that space, or whether it's a smaller regional grocery chain that prides
    itself on customer service. These are retro brands that are either defunct, or have few locations remaining after mergers. There are 30 classic grocery stores in this set.


    If you use lotplop, you can access all these as plop buildings. Grow lots are 3x6 and plop lots are 7x6.

    Plots 10-12 of my office buildings that I made from 2022-23. I just never got around to releasing the rest of the buildings. These are one floor versions (others I have released are two floors).


    27 office buildings, with 9 in each "office plot," for suburban areas. Inspired by the endless amounts of office buildings that often have no deviation on one another in N. America. These are all
    stage 2 3x2 commercial offices with 8 or so different brands on each one. Can be used with [LotPlop](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/) for office
    parks or can be built individually/grown. Often these buildings are used for branch offices outside of main headquarters for various reasons.


    The readme is a list of the companies on these buildings.
