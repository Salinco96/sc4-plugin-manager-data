    Note: For fitting with other seasonal items, props need to be planted the **1st September**. We do not recommand you to use seasonal trees on growable LOTs.


    This updated pack contains new seasonal props in the revised prop packs. The files (in the **VIPProps** folder) starting with VIP_Props_ are essential for the proper work of this mod as they
    contain the necessary model files, but they also contain props that can be used with [SC4PIM-X](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/29-modding-and-creation-tools/21-sc4pim)
