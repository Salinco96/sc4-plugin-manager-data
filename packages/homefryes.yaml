    "Simple and pragmatic, the classic American Four Square home, popularized by pattern books and Sears Roebuck & Company mail order kits, spread to residential neighborhoods throughout the United
    States."


    I have designed 12 homes altogether, 6 left-handed and 6 right-handed - in other words, mirrored, for variety. The lefts and rights are separated into the 2 "…family.dat" files. I put these into 8
    lots (2-1x1, 2-1x2, and 4-1x3), each designed to grow one of 6 homes at random; 4 lots for the lefts and 4 for the rights.


    These first models, based on my parents' house and with ideas taken from some of the kit floor plans I found in the Sears online archives, feature a bumped-out dining room window and stairway
    landing, full-width front porch, front and side dormers (some models), and many choices of siding and roofing materials and colors.

    the "family" concept.

    This is a set of 10 R$$ lots using building and prop families for many possible variations as they grow. The townhome/condominium buildings are based on a former builder here in the US called
    Cambridge Homes. The company has since been bought out by another builder, but when Cambridge was building their communities, they would usually give the streets British names. My buildings have
    the following features:


    - eight different colors (designed from real colors found on a vinyl siding website)


    - right- and left-hand models


    - 15°, 30° and 45° rotations to allow for multiple townhome communities.
