    **Description**: Stadium Village is expanding and the Llamas are on a winning streak. Stadium neighborhoods take on a character all their own, centered around a facility which can balloon in
    population for a few hours and bring a boost to local business.


    This pack contains four BATs, all of which have a ploppable version and three of which have a growable version (I figured no one would want a random building with rooftop stands popping up facing
    a residential high rise for example).


    \- *Quentin's Casa de Nachos (fictional)*: Nachos are a stadium staple, at least in America.


    \- *Yellowcard Diner (fictional)*: A soccer-themed retro American diner for only the most loyal Llamas fans.


    \- *Infield Fry Rule (fictional)*: A baseball-themed burger and fries type standard American restaurant.


    \- *Infusion Coffee and Tea (based on a real company)*: Infusion fills the role of Starbucks on the island of Guam, where there are no Starbucks, believe it or not. For this building they occupy
    the ground floor of a small collection of apartments. On the rooftop, there are bleachers inspired by the buildings across the street from Wrigley Field in Chicago. They would be strategically
    situated to allow more fans to catch a view of your game - adding more seats to a place in your city where there may be limitations on stadium expansion.


    **Stats**:


    Plop Cost: 4400


    Bulldoze Cost: 440


    Jobs: 21+ CS$$ jobs each


    Wealth: Medium


    Growth Stage: 2 (where applicable)


    Lot Size: 1x2


    Power Consumed: 4


    Water Consumed: 8


    Pollution: varies


    Landmark Effect: 79 over 19 (where applicable)


    Mayor Rating Effect: 10 over 256 (where applicable)


    **Dependencies**: None, the only props necessary I created and have included in the file and the fans are Maxis sims.
