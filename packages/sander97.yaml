  description: This is a park in the shape of a half circle. Around it are some semidetached houses. It is a really big lot (10x19) which you can find it in the park menu. It's based on a street in
    Duiven (the Netherlands) but the park is fictional.

  description: Another rowhouse because I needed some more variety in rowhouses in my city. It is a medium wealth building which grows on a 1x2 lot. I made it quick so the backyard has only grass but
    you can put trees or bushes in the backyard by using some MMPs.
