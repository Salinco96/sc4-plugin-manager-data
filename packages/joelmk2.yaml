    My first foray back into custom content after ~ten years away from the game, this pack is a DHL-themed building set. My earlier mostly-airports content posted at @joelyboy911.


    Originally intended as a lot for inclusion with modular airports, I have also included a non-airport themed I-M (Manufacturing) Ploppable lot. The building is loosely based on a real cargo
    facility at Auckland Airport in New Zealand.


    The pack contains the following lots:

      -  DHL Air Freight Centre - the main lot for placing in your airport, with the buildings and two cargo planes. This lot provides some I-M jobs.
      -  Additional plane parking lots - expand your air freight centre with extra planes (Boeing 777, 757, and Airbus A330), plus empty parking space and filler
      -  Non-Airport I-M Ploppable DHL Parcel Centre - uses the same buildings but not designed as part of modular airport. Similar style of lotting.

    Two building models are included (the office block and the warehouse). The Airbus A330 and Boeing 777 models are also included. The other props (including the Boeing 757) are found in the
    dependencies below. The original B777 model was made by pilotdaryl (adapted by me).
