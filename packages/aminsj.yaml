    One of the nicer things present in the gameplay loop of Cities: Skylines that was never *truly* around in the entire SimCity series is the monuments that you can build as an end-goal prize after
    completing a lot of challenges. I'm hoping to bring at least a little bit of that to SimCity 4 by making landmarks with larger goals to unlock them.


    The money tree used is from The Sims 3, and it gives you a passive income of approx. 133k. This is NOT a cheat lot, it is designed specifically to be a lategame regional landmark unlock trophy.
    You can turn it into a cheat lot if you want. The insanely high price is part of the challenge.
