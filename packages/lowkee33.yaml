    The Flora Tuning Exemplar defines the maximum height a tree will be placed in god-mode. It also makes it possible for seasonal flora to exist. Many terrain mods use this exemplar with different
    tree heights, however since they were made before seasonal flora was understood, a patch should be made. This is such a patch.


    This cross-platform package was assembled by Tyberius06. This installer aims to replace the former \*.exe installer while keeping the functionality of that one. The files were created by BSC
    member Lowkee33.


    **Compatibility**


    - Maxis Default Terrain

    - Every CycleDogg (CP) Terrain Mod on the LEX

    - Every Heblem Terrain Mod on the STEX

    - Orange_O's Pyrenean Terrain Mod on TSC

    - Every Terrain Mod on the PLEX

    - Every "Terrain Add-on" such as Eneddi's Jagged Edge mod, DobDriver's Stary Night Background, or a no-erosion mod that you may use.


    Note: The PyreneanTerrain Mod and Terrain Mods on the PLEX do not use the Flora Tuning Parameters. If you use these mods you should select "Maxis defualt or ANY other Terrain Mod" during
    Installation.


    Also note that this patch will have no effect on your non-seasonal items. However, there may be seasonal items that are not known. Please contact me in my [Flora Works at
    SC4D](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=12571.0) with any discoveries.


    At this point I hope that any new terrain mod will correct the Flora Tuning Parameters for Seasonal flora. Which is done by setting "mnMonthsBetweenCellCoverage" to "1". At that point it is also
    reccomended to set "mnRandomSeedingCellsPerMonth" to "0"
