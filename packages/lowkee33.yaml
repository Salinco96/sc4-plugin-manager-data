  description:
    The Flora Tuning Exemplar defines the maximum height a tree will be placed in god-mode. It also makes it possible for seasonal flora to exist. Many terrain mods use this exemplar with
    different tree heights, however since they were made before seasonal flora was understood, a patch should be made. This is such a patch.
