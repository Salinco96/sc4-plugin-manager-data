  description: >-
    This resource pack is a collection of chain link fence props that can be used on any type of lot that requires security fencing. The props in this pack may be used by other developers to enhance
    the appearance of their lots.


    The pack contains two styles of fencing (with or without barb wire) and includes extra items such as diagonal fence sections, corner sections, pedestrian gates and automatic rolling styled gates.


    ** This dependency has no dependencies.
