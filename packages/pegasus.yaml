    This is a RESOURCE file for the PEG\-CDK3 Seaport collection of lots. It is a required dependency, specifically, for the upcoming break-bulk freight dock lots and the new freight rail stations.


    The pack contains a ton of static, timed and random rolling stock & locomotive props. These are intended for use as props on various lots. These are NOT game automata... however, many will be
    released separately as such.


    \* As the game automata trains are considerably under scaled, these props are larger... and scaled to look more appropriate on lots with properly scaled structures, vehicles, peeps and other
    props.


    \*\* Players and developers may use these props on their own lots... subject to the terms of the EULA that is documented in the included readme file.

    This is a compilation of the primary CDK3 dependency files. If you already have the dependency files listed below, you will not have to download and install this file. However, all future CDK3
    lots requiring any of the listed dependencies, will list this file instead. There also may be a slight game load time reduction having all the dependencies combined into a single file.


    This SUPER PAK replaces the following CDK3 dependency files:


    > 1\. CDK3 Resource Pack 1 ( PEG\-CDK3_Resource-Pack_01.dat )


    2\. CDK3 Ship Pack 1 ( PEG\-CDK3_PropPack_Ships_01.dat )


    3\. CDK3 Vehicle Pack 1 ( PEG\-CDK3_PropPack_Vehicles_01.dat )


    4\. CDK3 Trawler Pack 1 ( CDK3_Trawlers_RESOURCE.dat )


    5\. CDK3 REC Boats Pack ( PEG\-CDK3_Rec-Boats_RESOURCE_101.dat )


    6\. CDK3 Basics\* ( PEG\-CDK3_Basics_100.dat )


    Once the CDK3 SUPER PACK is installed, you can safely remove the files listed above.


    <ins>IMPORTANT:</ins> The original CDK3 Basics file contained lots as well as dependency data. That dependency data only has been moved into the CDK3 SUPER PAK. The lot data only has been
    repackaged into a new file (version 1.10) which is included with this download. If you remove the original CDK3 Basics file, you should move the new version ( PEG\-CDK3_Basics_110.dat ) into the
    CDK3 Basics folder.

    Ladies & Gentlemen... The Great Lighthouse of Alexandria.


    Built to withstand the ravages of sea and time, The 40-story high Great Pharos Lighthouse stood as the tallest structure on Earth for almost 15 centuries... finally succumbing to a series of
    devastating earthquakes in the 1300s. Of the 6 fallen Ancient Wonders, the Lighthouse was the last to fall.


    Lost to The Ages, a team from the Pegadyne Oceanographic Institute recently located and recovered the ruins from the harbor of Alexandria. Strapped for cash, the local government eagerly sold the
    ruins to Pegadyne Industries who carefully preserved and transported them back to your city. And there, as yet another public relations coup for the corporation, the ruins have been restored to
    their prior glory and now serve as a museum of Ancient Civilization for all the world to enjoy. "


    This 8x8 lot (10x10 actual) historical landmark functions as a museum and serious tourist magnet. It contains all the properties and benefits of a normal museum (except plop price) and also
    includes the benefits of a landmark and tourist attraction.


    This is a massive monument, Boys & Girls... assembled modular style from 10 basic interconnecting models. Numerous other custom props, textures, and sound effects were designed exclusively for
    this lot... including 14 individual offset-rendered props and models just for the seawalls alone.


    The lot is designed to be plopped on water like the game's default seaport. However, it can also be plopped on dry land and used with the PEG Pond Kit to create a surrounding river or lake. The
    large parking area is transit enabled and when connected to your road network, cars and school buses will drive through it.


    \*\* Special thanks to BarbyW, Andreas, Blackbeard, & ParadiseFarm


    for their assistance during the development of this project.


    **The Great Lighthouse has NO mandatory external dependencies.**


    [The PEG Oasis Park](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/4592-peg-oasis-park-v205/) is recommended for expanding the museum/park complex.

    "Down in the valley... the valley so low. Hang your head over.... Let your lunch go!!"


    By request... we have added 4 new MTP style lots to add along your remote roadways or incorporate into your Mountain Trail system. These scenic look-outs will add an extra realistic feel to your
    blossoming mountainous and rural regions. No detail has been "overlooked" \[drum hit\]... including the prerequisite stone mounted plaque (recycled ranger station sign) that always recounts that
    here, on this spot, at some time, long ago, someone, did something note worthy. Thus, the plaque!


    The lots are designed to be plopped along the top of moderately steep cliffs. The viewing decks will extend over the edge and their foundations/supports will blend in with the face of the cliff.
    There are 4 lots in total; 2 for use with the PEG Mountain Trails and 2 for general use along any roadways. Additionally, there are 2 different styles of viewing decks; a standard straight deck
    and an "L" shaped deck for use on corners. The straight decks are part of a random prop family that includes 5 different styles of foundations/supports.


    Most of the lots provide some sort of rest-stop/picnic facilities. The straight roadside lot features an asphalt parking area that is transit enabled for a seamless connection to any adjacent
    roadway. All of the lots are very similar to a normal Mountain Trail lot with mild park & landmark properties and very little monthly maintenance costs. Lot sizes range from 1x1 to 2x2.


    \* The 2 different types of lots, Roadside & Mountain Trail, are contained in separate files so can easily remove either one if you choose not to use it. The Mountain Trail lots will appear in the
    Parks Menu, along with the other Mountain Trail lots. The roadside lots will appear in the Misc. Transportation Menu below the MTP Parking Lot lots..

    **UPDATE: 04.07.2022** - The *PEG_MTP_SUPER_TEXTURES_PACK.dat* has been replaced by the all inclusive **PEG\-SUPER_TEXTURES.dat**, which contains all, but the textures from the [PEG SPAM Super
    Resource Pack](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/26079-peg-spam-super-resource-pack/) (PEG\-SPAM_TEXTURES_RESOURCE_b200.dat), created and released by Pegasus from the entire collection
    (including: CDK and CDK3, CDK3\-OWW, OWW2 and Marina, Utopia, CSK, PPonds etc...). This update brings all these textures under one DAT (which actually already have held 2/3 of the textures created
    by Pegasus). Bear in mind this is only part one of a major update and clean-up of this dependency pack focusing on the textures for now.


    For the full list of texture contents please check the included \*-index.jpg files.


    Install: copy/extract the **PEGPROD** parent folder into your plugins. If you extracted the *\_Documents*\* folder into your plugins, too, it's highly recommended to keep it, but move it out of
    the Plugins folder.


    In the \_Documents folder you will find 2 other subfolders:


    - **PEG Readmes**: this folder will be the generic storage of all the readmes and images for the future updated PEGProd contents. This folder also contains the texture catalague index images of
    the base and overlay textures and the optional EU and RRW (Real-RailWay) texture overrides.

    - **PEG Optional Texture Overrides**: as a temporary solution it contains the ***PEG\-SUPER_TEXTURES_EUOverride.dat*** and ***PEG\-SUPER_TEXTURES_RRWOverride.dat*** files. To use either or both of
    the files, simply move/copy them into the main *PEGPROD\\Mountain Theme Pack\\\_MTP SUPER PACK\\* folder, but make sure they load after the PEG\-SUPER_TEXTURES.dat.


    The **v1.5** update is the first part of a collection wide update and cleanup focusing of the textures only. While the original textures and props where created by Pegasus and his team, this (and
    the following) update was made by the [@STEX Custodian](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/779745-stex-custodian/) (with the permission of Pegasus).


    \--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


    **Faster than a speeding Llama...** ( *a really old one... with gout* )**...**


    **More Powerful than my breath after a Tequila and burrito binge......**


    **Able to leap tall brown gift boxes in a single install.**


    **"LOOK !! Up on the STEX !! Its a Mod !! Its a Lot !! Its...** its..."


    "Oh forget it. Its just a dependency."


    You asked for it! And now you got it! The all-inclusive... the all encapsulating...one size fits all... MTP SUPER PACK !!


    *\* Tights & Cape sold separately. Tights void where prohibited. Do not wear capes near jet aircraft engines. Installation of the SUPER PACK may not enable you to fly.*


    The MTP SUPER PACK combines all the standard MTP dependencies into a single download... and also includes a substantial amount of new material that will be used in future development. This file
    will be the primary MTP dependency listed on all future MTP lots.


    * * *


    ***Please Note***: This dependency contains no material that alters the appearance ofgame default props or textures... and will not interfere in any way with playing a non-MTP or rural themed
    city.


    * * *


    The ****MTP SUPER PACK**** combines both MTP props and textures into a single download. However, it will install props and textures as separate files to make any future updates easier and faster.


    The **MTP SUPERPACK** replaces the following previous MTP dependencies... which can now be removed from your Plugins folder:


    \* **PEG Mountain Theme Pack**


    ( *PEG_MTP_RESOURCE_vol1.dat* & *PEG_MTP_TEXTURES_vol1.dat* )


    \* **PEG\-MTP Texture Pack Volume 2**


    ( *PEG\-MTP_TEXTURES_vol2.dat* )


    \* **PEG\-MTP Resource Pack 2 \[beta\]**


    ( *PEG\-MTP_RESOURCE2_b102.dat* )


    \* **PEG Pine Tree Mod \[ resource file only \]**


    ( *PEG\-MTP_GM-TreeMod_RESOURCE* )


    **\*\* This dependency has no dependencies.**

    The Oasis Park has returned with a few graphic upgrades. Two new BAT models have been added to give the oasis an improved 3D appearance and an upgraded surrounding wall. Other than being transit
    enabled for pedestrians, this park is identical to a large park in all aspects. It has lots of palms and other foliage and could be used as either an Oasis or Jungle themed park. A little break
    from the traditional for your Sims!

    **PEG One Flag Many Nations Mod**


    **By Pegasus**


    The One Flag... Many Nations mod allows Lot Developers to place a generic flag on their lots which will then display the user's specific or chosen national flag when that lot is used in their
    game. The player decides which flag will be displayed by installing the one modified flag .dat files enclosed in this mod.


    Players should follow the Installation instructions below very carefully. Developers can learn more as to how this mod works in the Developer's Notes section below.


    This is an updated version of the original mod and is dramatically reduced in size. To use this mod, the player must have the **Maxis Day of Peace** Add-On properly installed on their system:


    **\- [Direct Download Link](https://community.simtropolis.com/library/maxis/sc4/buildings/dayopeace.dat)**


    (Other Maxis Files can be downloaded [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/sc4-maxis-files/).)


    Please note that this mod merely references the flag graphic images contained in the Day of Peace Add-On. Additional flags can not be added unless created by Maxis or a 3rd party developer. If
    your flag isn't included and/or you prefer not to have a flag displayed on lots that use this mod, simply don't install this mod.

  description: >-
    I went out and bought SC4 on the very first day it was released. And from that day, the default tennis court park has bothered me and I couldn't figure out why. I even mentally played a tennis
    game on the default court: I serve... it goes long... and I watch the ball bounce out across the street and bean some old lady in the head. My second serve is returned and flies high and to the
    right... and I watch it skip across the railroad tracks and get crushed by a passing forklift.


    And then it hit me... **NO FENCES!!** I've never seen a tennis court that wasn't fenced in. Without fences, there would be 20 minute delays between serves while the players ran off to shag balls.
    An otherwise enjoyable game... would radically suck!


    Anyway... I put a custom BAT fence around the courts, stuffed 2 on a 3x3 lot and gave it some adequate parking. Voila!! Instant Tennis Park!!


    This 3x3 park has all the size, costs and benefits of the game's standard large park. The park was designed to be used with the [PEG Trail
    Parks](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11001-peg-trail-parks-iii/) but works just as well by itself. It does not require that you have the PEG Trail Parks installed. It is fully
    self-contained and has no dependencies.


    \* Like the PEG Krispy Kremes, this lot also uses a BAT modeled parking area instead of textures. This allows true 3D curbs, planters and sidewalks that add a depth and realism to the lot.

    The PEG Trail Parks have returned with a whole new visual makeover. This initial release introduces the new version of the basic Trail Parks... designed to blend seamlessly with the the [PEG
    Random Woods](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/4526-peg-random-woods-v206/) & the [PEG Stream Kit II](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11083-peg-stream-kit-ii-v205/).


    These new parks feature BAT modeled pathways that replace the old textured paths. This means that the paths now show while you are plopping the lots. This makes them much easier to use.


    These Trail Parks also feature two new trail lots that will allow you to run your trails anywhere. The new EL Transit lot will allow you to extend the trails under elevated rail & highways. The
    new Pedestrian Tunnel allows you to visually run your trails under any road or rail... or even under entire buildings or blocks.

  authors:

  description: >-
    After literally months in development and countless trips back to the drawing board, Pegasus Productions is proud to finally release this **Deluxe Edition** of the **Pond Kit**. Although similar
    in appearance, every lot and model have been rebuilt from the pond bottom up to eliminate the bad and make room for the good.


    Improvements in the Deluxe Edition include:


    1\. **NO SEAMS!!** That's right... those pesky hairline seams that appeared between many sections are now gone for good.


    2\. **Improved Slope Tolerance**. It is now possible to build a straight river up a modest slope. Larger areas such as ponds and lakes should still be built on level areas... but you can easily
    run straight sections of a river up a smooth incline.


    3\. **WATERFALLS!!!** Yes... we finally engineered an improved system for making waterfalls that are easy to plop and nice to look at. Blending old & new... texture and BAT, we now have a
    waterfall that will flex and stretch to fit any single-tile height slope you create. With left, center and right side waterfall lots, you can create a waterfalls virtually any width. These lots
    also include the top, center and bottom of the falls all in a single lot. No more separate top and bottom lots to contend with.


    4\. **Open Modular Architecture**. The Pond Kit has been restructured from the ground up to allow easier add-ons. This includes completely new pond styles that you will be able to change as easily
    as a rock or water mod style by simply exchanging a single file. This will also allow transparent versions of each style so those of you who use alternate terrain or snow mods will be able to use
    the ponds as well.


    5\. **Reduced Costs... Reduced Effects**. The plop and maintenance costs have been reduced significantly. Accordingly, the Park & Landmark effects have been reduced as well. Although the cost and
    effects for each lot was fairly modest, collectively, it all could easily add up to a significant monthly expense and and an easily capped out desirability. The new reductions should make even
    extensive water systems affordable and viable in rural and agricultural areas.


    6\. **Auto Update!!** Probably the best news of all for those with extensive Pond systems, this new kit will automatically update all your existing Pond lots in the game... except for the water
    tiles with Lilly Pads. Just remove the old files, install the new ones... and you're all set... except for replopping any Lilly Pad water tiles, of course.


    Collectively, all these new features add up to a much improved and much easier to use Pond/River development system. With these new standards now in place, the flood gates are finally open for new
    add-ons, new styles and lots of new development in your cities.

  category: parks
  description: >-
    Prepare for the onslaught as hoards of Leafers besiege your city every Fall to take in the beauty of the Autumn leaves. The Seasonal Woods lots are very similar to the PEG Random Woods... except
    these trees change with the seasons. Winter, Spring, Summer & Fall... the trees change to reflect the time of year in your cities. The Seasonal Woods also shuns the game's default "lolly-pop"
    trees and introduces 18 new BATed trees for greater realism.


    The Seasonal Woods provides you with a fast & flexible means of adding realistic woodlands to your cities and surrounding rural areas. The Seasonal Woods randomly generates different types of
    trees as you plop the lot. This eliminates the need of constantly rotating the lot when plopping for a random look... and provides a more natural & realistic look when covering large areas.


    The Seasonal Woods includes 4 new lots: A 1x1 lot with full ground texture. A 2x2 lot with full ground texture. A 1x1 lot with transparent ground texture. A 2x2 lot with transparent ground
    texture.


    The Random Forest is PEG tested & Tree-Hugger approved. Each lot has properties similar to a small green park with slightly improved air pollution qualities. This lot is also 'Slope Conforming' so
    you can place it almost anywhere.


    \*\* This lot was designed for seamless integration with the PEG Trail Parks and the PEG Stream Kit. Obviously, it can be used by itself, singularly or in groups, anywhere in your cities where you
    need a little flourish of flora.

    The **S**im**P**eg **A**gricultural **M**od (**SPAM**) is an absolute, total and complete replacement for the game-default farming system.


    The default system was never really finished before game release and was, in fact, designed to be short-lived and used only initially in starter cities. The game, as it progresses, actually is
    designed to kill off all desire and usefulness for farming.


    **We changed all that.**


    Not only have we changed how all the farms look... but we also changed how they play.


    Originally in a city, you could hug a tree... or kiss the sky with glass and steel. Now... you can do both.


    At its most basic function and goal, the SPAM is an *IND MTP Replacement Mod*... similar to the RES and COM MTP replacement mods.


    Its primary goal is to give an MTP\-ish look and feel to the game's default farm lots.


    Want to know more? Yeah of course... As a matter of fact, you NEED to know A LOT more - so before you install, we invite you to visit the Full ReadMe and learn more about these.

    **NOTE: You do not need this pack if you****already downloaded / plan to download the full**


    **SIMPEG AGRICULTURAL MOD (SPAM)!**


    This package is the main dependency for all things SPAM - from the main mod to most of the current or future additional sets. This standalone version is meant for all players who do not want to
    use the full mod but still wish to play with lots and items that utilize these props and textures.


    The SPAM SUPER PACK combines all SPAM props and textures into a single download. However, it will install props and textures as separate files to make any uture updates easier and faster.


    **INCLUDED**


    \* SPAM_Resource


    All models and props used for the agricultural mod


    \* SPAM_Crops_Resource


    All models and props for the seasonal crop varieties


    \* SPAM_Textures


    All textures used in the agricultural mod


    **NOTE: This pack includes no lots!**


    **AGAIN: You do not need this pack if you**


    **already downloaded / plan to download the full**


    **SIMPEG AGRICULTURAL MOD (SPAM)!**


    You can use all the material for your own lotting projects. However, you may not include any of these items with your uploads - please point to this pack as a dependency!


    **DEPENDENCIES**


    This dependency has no dependencies :-)


    \* The entire PEG SPAM collection is available on the PLEX (on the) STEX.
