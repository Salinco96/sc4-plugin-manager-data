    Faster than a speeding Llama... ( a really old one... with gout )...


    More Powerful than my breath after a Tequila and burrito binge......


    Able to leap tall brown gift boxes in a single install.


    "LOOK !! Up on the STEX !! Its a Mod !! Its a Lot !! Its... its..."


    "Oh forget it. Its just a dependency."


    You asked for it! And now you got it! The all-inclusive... the all encapsulating...one size fits all... MTP SUPER PACK !!


    * Tights & Cape sold separately. Tights void where prohibited. Do not wear capes near jet aircraft engines. Installation of the SUPER PACK may not enable you to fly.


    The MTP SUPER PACK combines all the standard MTP dependencies into a single download... and also includes a substantial amount of new material that will be used in future development. This file
    will be the primary MTP dependency listed on all future MTP lots.




    Please Note: This dependency contains no material that alters the appearance ofgame default props or textures... and will not interfere in any way with playing a non-MTP or rural themed city.




    The MTP SUPER PACK combines both MTP props and textures into a single download. However, it will install props and textures as separate files to make any future updates easier and faster.


    The MTP SUPERPACK replaces the following previous MTP dependencies... which can now be removed from your Plugins folder:


    * PEG Mountain Theme Pack

    ( PEG_MTP_RESOURCE_vol1.dat & PEG_MTP_TEXTURES_vol1.dat )


    * PEG-MTP Texture Pack Volume 2

    ( PEG-MTP_TEXTURES_vol2.dat )


    * PEG-MTP Resource Pack 2 [beta]

    ( PEG-MTP_RESOURCE2_b102.dat )


    * PEG Pine Tree Mod [ resource file only ]

    ( PEG-MTP_GM-TreeMod_RESOURCE )


    ** This dependency has no dependencies.

    NOTE: You do not need this pack if youalready downloaded / plan to download the full

    SIMPEG AGRICULTURAL MOD (SPAM)!


    This package is the main dependency for all things SPAM - from the main mod to most of the current or future additional sets. This standalone version is meant for all players who do not want to
    use the full mod but still wish to play with lots and items that utilize these props and textures.


    The SPAM SUPER PACK combines all SPAM props and textures into a single download. However, it will install props and textures as separate files to make any uture updates easier and faster.


    INCLUDED


    * SPAM_Resource

    All models and props used for the agricultural mod


    * SPAM_Crops_Resource

    All models and props for the seasonal crop varieties


    * SPAM_Textures

    All textures used in the agricultural mod


    NOTE: This pack includes no lots!

    AGAIN: You do not need this pack if you

    already downloaded / plan to download the full

    SIMPEG AGRICULTURAL MOD (SPAM)!


    You can use all the material for your own lotting projects. However, you may not include any of these items with your uploads - please point to this pack as a dependency!


    DEPENDENCIES


    This dependency has no dependencies :-)


    * The entire PEG SPAM collection is available on the PLEX (on the) STEX.
