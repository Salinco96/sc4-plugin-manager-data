    Faster than a speeding Llama... ( a really old one... with gout )...


    More Powerful than my breath after a Tequila and burrito binge......


    Able to leap tall brown gift boxes in a single install.


    "LOOK !! Up on the STEX !! Its a Mod !! Its a Lot !! Its... its..."


    "Oh forget it. Its just a dependency."


    You asked for it! And now you got it! The all-inclusive... the all encapsulating...one size fits all... MTP SUPER PACK !!


    * Tights & Cape sold separately. Tights void where prohibited. Do not wear capes near jet aircraft engines. Installation of the SUPER PACK may not enable you to fly.


    The MTP SUPER PACK combines all the standard MTP dependencies into a single download... and also includes a substantial amount of new material that will be used in future development. This file
    will be the primary MTP dependency listed on all future MTP lots.




    Please Note: This dependency contains no material that alters the appearance ofgame default props or textures... and will not interfere in any way with playing a non-MTP or rural themed city.




    The MTP SUPER PACK combines both MTP props and textures into a single download. However, it will install props and textures as separate files to make any future updates easier and faster.


    The MTP SUPERPACK replaces the following previous MTP dependencies... which can now be removed from your Plugins folder:


    * PEG Mountain Theme Pack

    ( PEG_MTP_RESOURCE_vol1.dat & PEG_MTP_TEXTURES_vol1.dat )


    * PEG-MTP Texture Pack Volume 2

    ( PEG-MTP_TEXTURES_vol2.dat )


    * PEG-MTP Resource Pack 2 [beta]

    ( PEG-MTP_RESOURCE2_b102.dat )


    * PEG Pine Tree Mod [ resource file only ]

    ( PEG-MTP_GM-TreeMod_RESOURCE )


    ** This dependency has no dependencies.

    This is a RESOURCE file for the PEG-CDK3 Seaport collection of lots. It is a required dependency, specifically, for the upcoming break-bulk freight dock lots and the new freight rail stations.


    The pack contains a ton of static, timed and random rolling stock & locomotive props. These are intended for use as props on various lots. These are NOT game automata... however, many will be
    released separately as such.


    * As the game automata trains are considerably under scaled, these props are larger... and scaled to look more appropriate on lots with properly scaled structures, vehicles, peeps and other props.


    ** Players and developers may use these props on their own lots... subject to the terms of the EULA that is documented in the included readme file.

    use the full mod but still wish to play with lots and items that utilize these props and textures.

    All models and props used for the agricultural mod


    * SPAM_Crops_Resource

    All models and props for the seasonal crop varieties

    You can use all the material for your own lotting projects. However, you may not include any of these items with your uploads - please point to this pack as a dependency!
