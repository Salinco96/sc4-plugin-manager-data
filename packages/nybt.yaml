    This is the NYBT essentials pack for many upcoming releases. It contains query windows - standard NYBT query windows for most common building types and a special 9/11 query. The essentials will be
    modified and improved when needed.


    Remember to put the essentials file into the Plugins folder in order to see the NYBT query windows.


    *   The standard NYC skyline can be changed into the new one, including new WTC complex - just unzip the file NYBT\_essentials\_new\_skyline into your plugin folder.

    *   If you wish to replace the standard Maxis query windows with the NYBT custom windows, unzip the file NYBT\_maxis\_query\_replace into the plugin folder. Remember to use NYBT essentials main
    file in order to see the custom headers.

    *   Tapscott Houses by Aaron Graham


    **DEPENDENCIES**

    **COMPATIBILITY**


    This download is only compatible with SimCity 4 "Rush Hour" or SimCity 4 Deluxe.


    **INSTALLATION**


    **Installation**: Run the Java installer (.jar extension), which will guide you through the installation process, or open it using 7-zip or Keka for manual install. If doing a manual install, go
    into the "installation" folder, then copy/extract the NYBT parent folder into your plugins. If you extracted the \_Documents folder into your plugins, too, it's highly recommended to keep it, but
    move it out of the Plugins folder.


    **Un-Installing**: To un-install the files, simply bulldoze every lot from this download in your cities and delete the files from the plugins folder afterwards.
