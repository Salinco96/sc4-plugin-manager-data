    This download contains 4 files that will add several flora items to you mayor-mode flora menu, including several types of seasonal flora. By default all 4 files are installed, but you can remove
    any of them if you don't want to use them. If you use the seasonal flora, you will have to run the game to anytime between August 5 and September 1, and then PAUSE, before plopping them. (These
    instructions will appear on the menu, in-game).


    ### Contents:


    - **MMP_for_BSC MEGA PropPack - CP Vol1.dat**

        Contains flora that will grow over time, along with ploppable logs, such as found along rivers and beaches of Northwestern North America, (and probably many other places too). This file adds 10 items to your mayor mode flora menu. (The menu icons have an orange background). The 10 items are:
    - Cypress Trees

    - Spruce Trees

    - Red Cedar Trees

    - Lodgepole Pine Trees

    - Redwood Trees

    - Juniper Trees

    - Subalpine Fir Trees

    - Ponderosa Pine Trees

    - Tropical Trees

    - Semi-Tropical Trees

    - Medium-size Pine Trees

    - Tall Conifer Trees

    - Mediterranean Trees

    - Desert Flora


    **CP_MMP_Seasonal_CP_MegaPropPack2.dat**


    Contains seasonal flora that changes three times per year. (This requires a dependency, noted below.) This file adds 6 items to your mayor mode flora menu. (The menu items have a greenish
    background.) The 6 items are:


    - Small Seasonal Shrubs

    - Large Seasonal Shrubs

    - Wide Seasonal Trees

    - Small Seasonal Trees

    - Street Trees (tree models with a narrow LOD at the trunk)

    - Seasonal Riparian Trees


    **CP_MMP_SemiSeasonal_CP_MegaPropPack2_Desert.dat**


    Contains semi-seasonal flora that changes two times per year. (This requires a dependency, noted below.) This file adds 1 item to your mayor mode flora menu, which contains semi-seasonal desert
    flora.


    It also contains two simple park lots with CycleDogg's timber flora. Look for the Timber Park - Spurce lots.


    This download is only compatible with SimCity 4 "Rush Hour" or SimCity 4 Deluxe.


    **DISCLAIMER**


    The usage of this download is at your own risk.


    **CREDITS**

    The Cycledogg Tree Controllers package includes all of the Tree Controllers by Cycledogg.


    The controllers are interchangeable with each other, which means you can play a city with one tree controller in your plugins folder (CPT_No7a_ItaliaRiver_TreeController.dat for example), and
    plant whatever god-mode or mayor-mode trees you want, then before you start the game the next time, you can replace with another controller, like CPT_No7a_MeadowshireCoast_TreeController.dat),
    then run the same city with no problems or conflicts. The trees that you planted using the CPT_No7a_ItaliaRiver_TreeController will be just as they were when you last saved the game, but the new
    trees you plant using the god-mode flora brush will be in the pattern defined by the new brush.


    What makes one tree controller different from another one is the pattern of trees that gets planted on the landscape when you use the god-mode flora brush tool. The mayor mode tools are the same
    for all controllers. If you never use the god-mode flora brush, then it doesn't matter which controller you install.


    **Default Maxis Tree Controller**


    **![](https://www.sc4evermore.com/images/jdownloads/screenshots/DefaultMaxisTreeController.jpg)**


    This tree controller adds 34 types of forest to your mayor-mode tree menu, but does not change your god-mode tree brush. If you want your god-mode tree brush to plant the default Maxis trees, or
    if you want to use someone else's god-mode tree mod (PEG's god-mode pine mod for example), this is the tree controller for you. This tree controller is unique in the CPT_No7a_ series in that it is
    the only one that will allow god-mode tree mods other than those in the "CPT" series to work properly with it.


    **Generic Tree Controller**


    **![](https://www.sc4evermore.com/images/jdownloads/screenshots/thumbnails/GenericTreeController.jpg)**


    This tree controller changes your god-mode flora brush to plop a variety of custom trees from shore line to timberline. The trees planted with this god-mode brush are the same as those planted by
    CPT_No7_Generic_Requires No8andNo9.dat (the previous version of this controller), which means this god-mode flora brush only plants Cycledogg and Maxis trees. This version of the "Generic" tree
    controller is uploaded to provide compatibility with other tree controllers in the CPT_No7a_ series. If you plan to use any of the tree controllers in the CPT_No7a series, you won't be able to use
    your old file any more. So you should throw it away and replace it with this file if you want to continue using the "generic" god-mode flora brush.


    **Painted Desert Tree Controller**


    **![](https://www.sc4evermore.com/images/jdownloads/screenshots/thumbnails/PaintedDesertTreeController.jpg)**


    This tree controller changes your god-mode flora brush to plant forests that have a Southwestern U.S. desert look at low elevations, and the look of denser mountain forests at higher elevations.
    This god-mode flora brush is designed to work best in combination with the Painted Desert Terrain Mod, but no terrain mods are required.


    **Italia River Tree Controller**


    **![](https://www.sc4evermore.com/images/jdownloads/screenshots/ItaliaRiverTreeController.jpg)**


    This tree controller changes your god-mode flora brush to plant forests with a Mediterranean look. This god-mode flora brush is designed to work best in combination with the Italia Terrain Mod,
    but no terrain mods are required.


    **Meadowshire Coast Tree Controller**


    **![](https://www.sc4evermore.com/images/jdownloads/screenshots/thumbnails/MeadowshireCoastTreeController.jpg)**


    This tree controller changes your god-mode flora brush to plant forests suitable for a Western European/Eastern North American region. The god-mode flora brush plants conifers and deciduous trees,
    but fewer really tall ones than some of the other tree controllers in the series. Along the water, Maritime forests are planted. This god-mode flora brush is designed to work best in combination
    with the Meadowshire Terrain Mod, but no terrain mods are required.


    **Meadowshire River Tree Controller**


    **![](https://www.sc4evermore.com/images/jdownloads/screenshots/thumbnails/MeadowshireRiverTreeController.jpg)**


    This tree controller changes your god-mode flora brush to plant forests suitable for a Western European/Eastern North American region. The god-mode brush plants conifers and deciduous trees, but
    fewer really tall ones than some of the other tree controllers in the series. At lower elevations, the emphasis is on leafy green deciduous trees. Along the water, Riparian forests are planted.
    This god-mode flora brush is designed to work best in combination with the Meadowshire Terrain Mod, but no terrain mods are required.


    **Missouri Breaks Tree Controller**


    **![](https://www.sc4evermore.com/images/jdownloads/screenshots/thumbnails/MissouriBreaksTreeContoller.jpg)**


    This tree controller changes your god-mode flora brush to plant forests in a pattern similar to what you might find in Southern Alberta, Eastern Montana, Eastern Wyoming or Colorado. (some of the
    trees are the actual species you will find in these areas). At low elevations, the god-mode flora brush will leave large areas free of trees, to create the type of wide open spaces the
    above-mentioned areas are famous for. This god-mode flora brush might work well for people with a not-so-up-to-date computer, since it limits the number of trees planted on the terrain. It is
    designed to work best in combination with the Missouri Breaks Terrain Mod, but no terrain mods are required.


    **Olympic Coast Tree Controller**


    **![](https://www.sc4evermore.com/images/jdownloads/screenshots/thumbnails/OlympicCoastTreeController.jpg)**


    This tree controller changes your god-mode flora brush to plant forests that have a Pacific Northwest look (many of the trees are the actual species you will find along the Washington, Oregon or
    British Columbian coast). This god-mode flora brush is designed to work best in combination with the Olympic Terrain Mod, but no terrain mods are required.


    **Compatibility**


    This download is only compatible with SimCity 4 "Rush Hour" or SimCity 4 Deluxe. It is compatible with all other mayor-mode tree mods, but incompatible with all other god-mode tree mods. Only one
    file beginning with "CPT_No7a_" should be in your plugins folders at a time.


    **Troubleshooting**


    "Yuck, those don't look like trees. They look like brown boxes!" - You are missing one or more of the dependencies listed above.


    "All of the 34 new menu items in the mayor mode tree menu are doubled up (or tripled or quadrupled, etc)." - You have installed more than one CPT_No7a file to your plugins folder. Remove all but
    one of them. You can only have one CPT_No7a file in your plugins at a time.


    "Some of the 34 new menu items in the mayor mode tree menu are doubled up, but not others" - You have an old, incompatible tree controller file in one of your plugins folders. The "Compatibility"
    section above lists files to search for and remove from your plugins. You may want to check your Program Files plugins folders in addition to your My Documents plugins folders.


    "OK, I installed the mod but where are the trees? My region looks the same as it did before" - Sorry, the trees won't magically appear in the game. You have to plant them using the mayor-mode tree
    tool.


    "I uninstalled the mod. The trees disappeared like I wanted them to, but now my city crashes when I try to do anything in areas where the forest used to be." - As with most BATs, you need to
    bulldoze the trees before uninstalling. So, to solve this problem, reinstall the mod, bulldoze the trees, then uninstall again.


    **Credits**


    Special thanks to the following BATters for their wonderful tree/flower/shrub models: Jeronij, Couchpotato, Simgoober, JohnB, Dolphin66, Swi21, and Ripptide, and to Andreas Roth for his help with
    the readme and the installer. Also, thanks to the BSC team for their testing and feedback. Thanks also to Jeronij, and Colyn for hosting my files at SC4Devotion and to BarbyW for compiling the BSC
    LEX DVD.
