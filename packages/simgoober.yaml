    In 2002, 7-Eleven, Inc. celebrated its 75th birthday. 7-Eleven pioneered the convenience store concept, starting in 1927 as the Southland Ice Company in Dallas, Texas.


    Both of these lots make use of prop / building families, to add variety to the game. The 7-Eleven building has 8 different styles, each of which has a random chance of showing up when either lot
    is developed.


    Please feel free to alter this lot for your own personal use, but do not redistribute this lot in any form without permission from a BSC member. If, at some future date, members cannot be reached,
    be sure to give credit to the BSC team, and the origonal designer; SimGoober

    This is an updated version of an older release of mine. The model is the same, but the lots have been completely redone, to make them more playable. The building values are more in line with the
    Maxis standards, as we have learned them since the initial release of this creation. I would suggest deleting the older versions before installing this one.

    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the Residential Houses by legendary BSC BATer **SimGoober**, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion and also on the
    Simtropolis STEX. It includes the contents of 36 previously separate downloads (including one previously unavailable "lost" content, the *Schmucker House*).


    After battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to
    collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack ***may*** receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and
    provide technical support for the pack.


    Bear in mind this Lot Collection contains lots which will only grow/work if **CAM** (**Colossus Addon Mod**) is installed.


    In this installer the CAM folder (which contains the CAM lots) is NOT selected by default, if you play with the Colossus Addon Mod and wish to use these CAMelots you need to select the folder
    manually when you run the installer.


    ### **INSTALLATION**


    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.


    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\--or a zip tool capable
    of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), and for macOS, use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).


    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything).
    Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). After this, click over to the Install tab, and click
    "Start installation" to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.


    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins.


    Optionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective and optionally separately all the individual cleanitol files and by using either the newer **[nos.17's SC4
    Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/)** or the older **BSC Cleanitol** tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.


    ### **DEPENDENCIES**


    The following files are required in order for the contents of this package to appear correctly (i.e., no "brown boxes" or missing textures):


    - [SC4D LEX Legacy - BSC Common Dependencies Pack **v9**](https://sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/3-sc4d-lex-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack) (and above)

    ### **CREDITS**


    The following BSC members contributed models, textures, and modding support to this collection:


    - SimGoober


    This package was assembled by Tyberius06.


    ##### Special Thanks


    Webmaster & administration staff at SC4Evermore and SC4 Devotion.


    For memo for subsequent updates on the NAM/Java installer.


    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)


    ### **CONTENTS**


    This package contains the following previously-separate downloads (where you see links in those cases the original uploads are still available, **but the contents of this package are superior
    compared to those old versions**) . Some of the Lots contained in the package exceed Stage 8, and therefore require the use of the Colossus Addon Mod (CAM). See the notes, which contents require
    CAM to be installed.
