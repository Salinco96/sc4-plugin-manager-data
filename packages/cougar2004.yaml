    This mod fixes a problem with the default Maxis Space Port, which claims it "Provides a boost to high-tech industry" however, it does not. Maxis forgot to include this boost, therefore it boosts nothing but costs and some slight commercial desirability.

    This mod fixes that. A significant yet realistic (non-radical) boost to High Tech Industry is now provided. Placing the Space Port now provides 150,000 High-Tech Industry Cap Relief. This is well within the range of other similar buildings such as the Advanced Research Center, University, and Marina.

    **Alternate Version**

    For those who feel the default Maxis Space Port uses far too much power for its size and function, a second Mod file is provided in this download. In addition to fixing the High-Tech Boost, this ALT Mod version lowers power requirements from the default 700 to 219. This should allow most cities to stay safely under the power abilities of a single power plant with the Space Port placed.

    Additionally, the included ALT Mod version also increases the Space Port from 100 R$ Jobs to a more realistic spread of 8 R$, 104 R$$, and 16 R$$$, to cover the range of employees from Astronauts down to Janitorial staff. Water consumed is decreased slightly from 360 to 248. Monthly Cost is lowered from $400/mo to $300/mo. And Bulldoze Cost of $4200 is now $3900. No other changes have been made to how the Space Port looks or functions.


    Impact of this Mod will only be seen when you have met all SC4 requirements for High-Tech Industry and have placed the Space Port *(from Rewards Menu)* in your city, with this Mod installed.
