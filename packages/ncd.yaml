    In this mega-pack are base and overlay textures used in the creation of more realistic railyards and industrial rail lots. Included in this set are rail spurs, multi-track switches, roadcrossings,
    and some miscellaneous base and overlay textures.


    The primary use for the base and overlay textures is for prop placement within the lot you are trying to create. So far, all props work normally no matter where they are placed on the tile, eg;
    train cars and locomotives used as props will appear and disappear according to their schedule if that is what they are supposed to do. Static props will remain..., umm..., static.


    I have created mainly BASE textures so that road overlays can be used with the track textures that have room for them, eg. track textures that use 1/2 or less of the tile space. It is understood
    that you can place more than one overlay texture on a tile, but this increases the number of objects used by the SC4Lot file. The ability to use a single base texture with only one overlay cuts
    down the number of objects used by the lot file, enabling you to place more props.


    **Special Note on Textures used in the Lot Editor:**


    Please keep in mind that textures by themselves CAN NOT be 'transit enabled', only lots can be 'transit enabled'. Also, you can transit enable the lot that uses these textures, but the game's
    automata will only use the 2 tracks in the center of the tile if it is used for Stations(Freight and Passenger).


    The game will ignore the tracks on the left and right side within the tile and if you transit enable a tile with only a single track running through it, you may see train automata running across
    empty ground.


    The only exception is custom made Path Files, which is beyond the scope of this Texture Pack. Future lots using these textures will possibly have custom Path Files.


    Let me know what you think. Be Constructive!


    As of **Network Addon Mod V37** the default rail has become the **RealRailWay** (RRW) (instead of the original Maxis Rail). The textures in this pack are meant to be compatible with the original
    Maxis Rail textures, but you can find RealRailWay compatible override sets for this and many other rail textures in the following:
