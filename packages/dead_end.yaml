    This download contains lots for three different supermarket franchises from Scandinavian countries: [Joker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joker_%28store%29) (growable 3x2 and 4x2)
    [Kiwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwi_%28store%29) (ploppable monument 3x2) and [REMA 1000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REMA_1000) (growable 3x2). The latter two lots are meant for more
    urban environments and as such do only come with a parking lot for bikes ![^_^](https://community.simtropolis.com/assets/emoticons/default_5.gif "^_^"). All lots feature 32 CS$$ jobs. I created
    these for my own towns and cities, but hopefully someone else will find them useful as well.


    The attached screenshot shows my custom pavement (created through [@rsc204](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/651629-rsc204/)'s
    [MTRDK](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30033-mgb-maxis-texture-replacement-dev-kit/)) and grass (Lowkee's [Appalachian terrain
    mod](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/37-terrain-mods-and-tree-controllers/41-appalachian-terrain-mod-by-lowkee33)). As far as I know the used texture ID's are standard, so
    it should work whether or not you're using particular mods. Let me know in the comments if you run into any trouble!


    Special thanks to [@rsc204](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/651629-rsc204/) for the building models and [@pclark06](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/364367-pclark06/) for the
    branding props!

    Note: Only after uploading this set I realized the sign for the REMA 1000 was off-centered in comparison to the other two supermarkets. This has since been fixed, but the screenshot does show the
    older version. It should show up fine in the game.

    [Spar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spar_%28retailer%29) is a Dutch multinational franchise of supermarkets. I created this 6x4 growable lot specifically for my Scandinavian towns and cities, but
    it should fit in well with other regional styles as well. In theory this should grow on any of the tile sets, but I recommend plopping it through the 'buildingplop' cheat if you're having issues.
