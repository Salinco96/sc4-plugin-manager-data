    This set of Subway Entrance Props is intended for use with the [Roadtop Mass-Transit package](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=13510) but it can be used in other lots as well.


    The prop models have been derived from two models made by Mcdrye and RalphaelNinja. These are special narrow versions specifically modified for RTMT (original models in [London Underground
    Station](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=11756) and [Ninja Boulevard Kiosk](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=3195)/[Ninja Boulevard Kiosk
    Model](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=3196)).


    This pack contains twelve new props, derived from the above two models, and differ only in the railings' colours:


    - RalphaelNinja's comes in eight colours, four classic (Black, Steel Blue, Dark Green and Gray) and four modern ones (Red, Yellow, Turquoise and Deep Blue), in addition to the original White.


    - Mcdrye's comes in Black, Steel Blue, Dark Green and Metallic, and has the roundel removed. The Steel Blue colour matches the Maxis' one.


    **Credits:**


    Many thanks to Mcdrye and RalphaelNinja for their models.


    Please check the Readme for detailed installation instructions.

    This pack contains 5 Logistics Centres Lots for your cities, 4 RCI and an Enhanced Freight Rail Station.


    The BATs are warehouses and ancillary buildings. They are completely fictional, but I have used the logos and liveries of containers of real companies.


    All lots look the same and are 10x10 tiles large. They widely use prop families. As a result, you will get a different prop combination (and appearance) each time you grow or plop them. In
    addition many of them are time-dependent, eg the trucks appear and disappear periodically while the gates close during the night. The streets inside the lots as well as the parking areas are
    transit- and UDI\-enabled. Also they spawn freight truck and train vehicles.


    The RCI lots are actually commercial services. One would say to make them industrial, however this kind of operations is essentially commercial, plus industry tends to decline as HQ and EQ rise
    while CS demand is usually all-high, especially after offices have developed and displaced services. The stats are all the same.


    The Freight Rail Station is specially modded so as to become two-way (provide both rail-to-truck and truck-to-rail traffic conversions). It also lifts caps for the ID and IM sectors.

    This pack of warehouse props is currently used in the [Logistics Centres Mega-Pack](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=16119) lots.


    There are twelve BATs in total, plus a special horizontal floodlight model (lightcone).


    I have split the package into two parts, so that you can easily download it, even if you are on dial-up.


    Part A contains five large warehouse props.


    The plugin contains the model files only. No lots, building or prop exemplars are contained, so if you want to use these props in your lots you will have to make your own, by using the Plugin
    Manager and/or the Reader (the XML files are contained in the datfile).


    Lotmakers may use these props in their lots, but not include (redistribute) the models in their plugins. Instead, they must point users to download the models from this page.


    **Credits**


    I would like to thank 6459978., jasoncw, jestarr, johnb, scipio, sargeantcm, spa and trigger_tre for their BATting advice and the commenting/reviewing they have provided.
