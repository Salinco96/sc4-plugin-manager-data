    This pack of warehouse props is currently used in the Logistics Centres Mega-Pack lots.


    There are twelve BATs in total, plus a special horizontal floodlight model (lightcone).


    I have split the package into two parts, so that you can easily download it, even if you are on dial-up.


    Part A contains five large warehouse props.


    The plugin contains the model files only. No lots, building or prop exemplars are contained, so if you want to use these props in your lots you will have to make your own, by using the Plugin
    Manager and/or the Reader (the XML files are contained in the datfile).


    Lotmakers may use these props in their lots, but not include (redistribute) the models in their plugins. Instead, they must point users to download the models from this page.


    Credits

    I would like to thank 6459978., jasoncw, jestarr, johnb, scipio, sargeantcm, spa and trigger_tre for their BATting advice and the commenting/reviewing they have provided.
