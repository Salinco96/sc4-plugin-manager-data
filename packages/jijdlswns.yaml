    **jijdlswns - Resvi's canal**


    This is my first set of canals I have made that are inspired by European canals. In total there are 3 pieces


    ### INSTALLATION:


    This package is a simple .zip file. Just extract the ks_jpn folder to your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins directory (or equivalent, if you have a custom Plugins folder location).


    It is highly recommended to run the cleanitol with the installer and remove any previous versions from your plugins.


    Optionally in the ~Documents folder in the main ZIP you can find a collective/master and by using either the newer [nos.17's SC4
    Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/) or the older BSC Cleanitol tool you can search and remove old and outdated versions of these files.


    ### DLL DEPENDENCIES:


    In order for the contents of this package to display correctly by taking advantage of the new DLL Mods requires the complete installation of the following dependencies (the below listed
    dependencies are covering a full install):


    - [**Submenus DLL**](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36142-submenus-dll/ "memo.submenus.dll") - You need it to get the package submenu working.

        Compatible only with the digital version (1.1.641) of SimCity 4 (Microsoft Windows and Linux only).
