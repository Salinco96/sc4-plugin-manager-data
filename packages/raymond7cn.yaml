    Churchill_Plaza, by Raymond


    \=================================


    The statue of Winston Churchill in Parliament Square, London, is a bronze sculpture of the former British prime minister Winston Churchill, created by Ivor Roberts-Jones.


    It is located on a spot referred to in the 1950s by Churchill as "where my statue will go". It was unveiled in 1973 by his widow Clementine, Baroness Spencer-Churchill, at a ceremony attended by
    the serving Prime Minister and four former Prime Ministers, while Queen Elizabeth II gave a speech.


    The statue is one of twelve statues on or around Parliament Square, most of well-known statesmen.
