    **Installation**: COPY/Extract the **Mntoes** parent folder from the \*.zip into your Plugins folder. If you extracted the *~Documents* folder into your plugins, too, it's highly recommended to
    keep it, but move it out of the Plugins folder.

    **To uninstall**: bulldoze any instance of this lot in your city, then remove the file(s) from your Plugins.

    Mntoes Holt Farm Close


    I first started these Bats way back in 2006 and I never quite got the time to finish them due to RL. I have a bit more free time now so here they are complete at last. I hope the wait was worth
    it.


    The pack consists of 3 lots (two dat files standard and high def versions)


    R$4_3x2 Holt Farm Lot one (40 res)


    R$4_3x2 Holt Farm Lot two (40 res)


    R$4_3x2 Holt Farm Lot Three (40 res)


    It is important that you place only one of these dat files in your plugins folder.


    either:-


    Mntoes Holt Farm Close Std.dat


    or


    Mntoes Holt Farm Close HD.dat


    Pollution-low


    Garbage -low


    Hospital Grade-


    Crime-low


    As you may know I am not a lover of dependencies so all the custom props and textures needed are included with the download.


    Included also in this pack are 2 3ds model files:-


    Mikeseith Corrola


    &


    Sheep Skoda Fabia


    Thanks guys for the models & textures.


    Hope you enjoy
