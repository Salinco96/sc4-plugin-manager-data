    This prop pack includes all the necessary items for my first residential set, including:

    * House props

    * Backyard props (mostly semi-seasonal)

    I got MandelSoft's permission to use his great light cones in my streetlights, which are included.

    This set is inspired in the Spanish architecture from 1800's to 1920's.

    This is a low wealth and low density residential set inspired in Spanish urban architecture from 1800's to 1920's. You can find this architecture in large areas of Spain and South America.
    This kind of houses are a variation of traditional Roman-Arabic houses in Spain, which were built around an inner courtyard. By the years most of these houses were split into two houses, now with side-yards. During the XIX century new houses were built already in such way due to the lack of space in the fast growing cities.

    I tried to make the houses to match the style of as many countries as possible, so perhaps you won't recognize any special country in them. I hope you like them.

    This is my first building set.

    Lots' Information:

    * Zone: Residential
    * Density: Low Density
    * Wealth: Low Wealth
    * Building Style: European
    * Lot Sizes: 1x2,1x3,2x2,2x3 (corner lots: 1x2, 2x2)
    * Inhabitants: 7 to 35 (7 per home)

    The lots represent different growth stages. You'll find lots with a lot of free space and others totally built. Normally all the free spaces disappear with the natural city growth.
