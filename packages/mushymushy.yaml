    HD North American 40ft Semi Trailers Vol01 by MushyMushy


    This is a prop pack containing 68 unique HD 40ft semi trailer models, all of which are based on North American designs. All models are rendered at 90, 45, 22.5L, and 22.5R angles with reasonably
    tight LODs to provide maximum flexibility. This pack includes 40ft box trailers in several liveries with and without cabs, and later packs will include other various trailers and possibly other
    cabs. Please note that as this is a prop pack, there are no Lots included - you must put the props on a Lot using the Lot Editor for them to show up in-game. All props can be easily found in the
    LE by typing "MM_" into the search bar.


    Contents:

      -  40ft box trailers with blank white, DHL, FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, Roadway, USPS, and Yellow liveries.
      -  All trailers are also paired with either a Mack CH613 or a Mack MR688 in various colors.
      -  Keep in mind that this pack does not have any standalone cabs (without trailers), to get those you need to download this pack.

    Dependencies:

      -  None, this is intended to be a dependency

    Enjoy!
