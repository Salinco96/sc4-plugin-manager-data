    This mod doubles the number of jobs provided by the in-game industry buildings. There are 4 files you can optionally install; they double the jobs for each industry category (farming, dirty, manufacturing, and high-tech). So, you don't have to double all the industry categories if you don't wish to do so; you can pick & choose.

    I made this mod after trying out the industry-quadrupler mod on this site. I found that mod to be unbalanced, and in the "cheat" category, so I made an alternative mod to be more balanced with the rest of the game.

    1\. I only doubled the number of jobs, rather than quadrupled them. I found 4x was just too much.

    2\. I doubled the building tax values. This makes the income from industry to be the same as the default for the same number of jobs. This allows a "industry city" to be economically feasible, just as with the default game values.

    3\. I doubled the power and water requirements for the buildings. This means you have to spend the same amount of money to support a similar number of jobs as you would with the game default. (I found this balance to be lacking in the industry quadrupler.)

    4\. I doubled the pollution from each building. Again, this means that the same amount of jobs will produce the same amount of pollution as with the game's default. (Again, missing in the 4x mod.)

    See the readme for installation details.

  category: gameplay
  description: |-
    The intent of this mod is to reduce the amount of abandonment and dilapidation of high-wealth buildings. It does this in a non-cheating natural way, to prevent high-wealth buildings from growing in areas that will likely cause them to abandon in the near future. There are other mods to prevent dilapidation, but they do it by forcibly preventing dilapidation in buildings that really should dilapidate. This mod stops those buildings from growing in the first place.

    This mod changes the desirability building requirements for high-wealth construction. The default game setting is to allow buildings to grow in areas with as little as 20% desirability (or greater). Unfortunately, dilapidation of buildings also begins to occur in areas with 20% desirability (or less). So what the game does is build a nice-looking R$$$ building (or CO$$$ or whatever) in a bad area, and then it quickly abandons or dilapidates the building, creating an ugly blackened building.

    Much of the current wisdom on Simtropolis seems to state that R$$$ abandonment is the result of too-few jobs for rich sims. While this is true in some cases, my tests have shown that most of the abandonment occurs for desirability reasons. The R$$$ build houses in borderline areas, and then low desirability kills them off. Fewer R$$$ pushes up demand, and that causes more R$$$ homes to be built in borderline areas, and the cycle repeats. This mod stops that cycle by preventing those homes from being built in borderline areas.

    This mod changes the building desirability requirement to 40%-50%, instead of 20%. Thus, a high-wealth building will not grow in a borderline area.

    The result is that less high-wealth buildings will grow in your city, but those that do grow will have a much greater chance of "sticking around" without abandoning or dilapidating. You'll also notice that your cities will retain more CS$ and CS$$ buildings, rather than them all being replaced by CO$$ and CO$$$.

  category: gameplay
  description: |-
    Some people have played SimCity 4 for quite awhile, and never seen a riot. That's not surprising, since you normally have to have a very unhappy city to create a riot.

    This mod makes riots much more common, so that everyone can experience the chaos of anarchy. It forces you to keep your mayor rating significantly above +50 if you want to prevent riots. If sims in parts of your city drop their rating of you below +50, watch out!

    To install, just unzip and drop into your plugin file. To remove, just delete it from your plugin file. It won't have any impact on your cities once it is removed.
