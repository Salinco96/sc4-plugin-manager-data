    **Updated July 28, 2007!** All my old files are being updated and re-released to fix a host of minor issues and mistakes I made when I was still learning. The lot and desc files are the same the
    original meaning that the new version will replace the old one in your cities without any brown boxes as long as you delete the previous version. A BSC Cleanitol file will be available on
    [SC4Devotion](http://www.sc4devotion.com/)'s BSC exchange as soon as I have all the updated files released, which will make the job of deleting the old versions easy.


    The Bank of Montreal (BMO) is Canada's oldest bank. It was founded in Montreal in 1817. Until the creation of the Bank of Canada in 1935, the Bank of Montreal served as Canada's central bank.
    Today, BMO has lost its dominant position and is the smallest of Canada's five major banks. Its Toronto headquarters is the largest office tower in Canada.


    This BAT is part of my five BAT set of Canadian bank branches that is designed to help relieve some of the monotony of small Maxis commercial service buildings. It is based on a real BMO branch
    located on Quinpool Road in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Included in this upload is a growable and a ploppable version with identical stats. Both come on a 2x2 lot and provide 90 Cs$$. The growable
    version does work and grows easily (stage 3, Houston and Euro tilesets). One dependency, SPA essentials available [here](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=18274). See the readme for
    more detailed stat information and installation instructions.
