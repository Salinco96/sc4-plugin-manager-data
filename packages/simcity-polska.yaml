    This is an overall compilation (update and expansion) of **Aras**'s so called AC Saturn Prop Pack and his several industrial related models which were released separately on the SimCity Polska
    Site, which is no longer running. Also it contains some of the loose separately released single models from a few authors and some other industrial related models. This is a **dependency
    package**, and it doesn't contain any ploppable or growable elements. Although it can be used for creating new lots with Maxis Lot Editor or PIM\-X.


    (Sidenote: none of these models and props are my (Tyberius06/STEX Custodian) creations. These were created by **Aras**/AC, kb7/**kbieniu7**, **Perun**, **MRQS**, **Rajfurke** and **Zarzyk**. All
    credits go to them.)


    This is a dependency package, which contains 53 models and props (it doesn't contain any ingame ploppable elements) compiled/merged into one single \*.dat file. These are not new contents per se,
    they were released either separatelly in smaller prop packs or as part of other uploads on the demissed SimCity Polska (SCP) site. The props and models for the mega prop pack come from different
    sets from different times and therefore their quality is not equal. It contains props and models from Aras's AC Satrun Prop Pack and other industrial related models and props from his separate
    uploads, also from different creators.


    After I revisited the originally released all-in-one Polish Mega Prop Pack, I decided to eventually separate Aras's and others industrial related props from the more general contents. Therefore
    this **Polish Mega Props - MISC Industrials** superseds the previously released AC Saturn Prop Pack from Aras, which was released on SimCity Polska and later on STEX.


    For more information see the provided readme.


    **LIST OF ITEMS**:


    \* Various models and props. **Bear in mind, this upload doesn't contain any plopable or growable lots, these are only props** used as dependencies for some lots and can be used by anybody for
    their own lotting projects.

    UPDATE: 11.07.2021 - There are mayor changes comparing to the previously released Polish Mega Prop Pack Vol. 1.dat. As it was mentioned by some fellow players one year ago, the original package
    was too big and less coherent. It took a while, but I did a separation (see changelog below), and took out the industrial related and/or previously released individual contents. Though I added a
    few generic items from Kbieniu, now most of the industrial related creations from Aras and some others can be found in a separate [Polish Mega Props - MISC
    Industrials](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/33309-ac-saturn-prop-pack/).


    ~~This is an overall compilation of separate unique prop packs from the SimCity Polska site, which is no longer running.~~ This is a **dependency package**, and it doesn't contain any ploppable or
    growable elements. Although it can be used for creating new lots with Maxis Lot Editor or PIM\-X.


    (Sidenote: none of these models and props are my (Tyberius06/STEX Custodian) creations. These were created by the below listed custom content creators. All credits go to them.)


    This is a dependency package, which contains 155 models and props (it doesn't contain any ingame ploppable elements) compiled/merged into one single \*.dat file. These are not new contents per se,
    they were released either separatelly in smaller prop packs or as part of other uploads on the demissed SimCity Polska (SCP) site. The props and models for the mega prop pack come from different
    sets from different times and therefore their quality is not equal. It contains props and models from the original Polish Prop Packs (1-2) made by **Fordoniak**/adik151/adrian10; from **Aras**'s
    Polish Bus Props Pack; Bus Depo, border control office, rural polish bus sheds and Palm Tree props made by **Kbieniu**, and some smaller separatelly released props from different creators, like
    **RaV**, **Ferox** and **szymcar** .


    Detailed list of the used contents is available in the attached readme file.
