  description: >-
    This is a prop pack for Victorian and early 20th century British style street furniture. These props are intended to period use, but time scale is long. The props are based on real life examples
    and can be seen on British streets even today. Although many, such as village pump or cattle trough, are left as ornate and do not carry anymore the original function.


    I have made and included 23 props and 4 functional lots.


    1 x Police box (Prop & Functional police kiosk)


    1 x Village Pump (Prop & Functional water tower)


    2 x Phone Boxes (K1 and K6 type)


    1 x Drinking Fountain


    6 x Mail Boxes


    2 x Bollards


    2 x Benches


    2 x Litter Bins


    2 x Cattle Troughs


    As for a bonus, three Irish colour variations.


    8 x Newspaper Headlines Boards


    4 x Pub Sign Sandwhich Boards.


    4 x Pub Benches.


    (These are intended as props for my forthcoming Clerkenwell Close building pack.)


    Items are grouped into separate folders and unwanted can be deleted. For example, the functional lots can be deleted as these are not dependencies.

    My British building journey continues. This time three stone building variations. Historic houses that can be found in Northern England and possibly in Scotland and Ireland. Two residences and one
    small commercial shop. These can be used in both rural and town environments as 1x2 lots are wall-to-wall buildings.


    The buildings and textures are based on Bilteezi railway model cardkits. This has helped me to get sizes and shapes right. Also, for some reason, Bilteezi texture suite well with HD. There are
    little ill effects even in level 5 zoom.

  description: >-
    The Clerkenwell Close terrace row is based on a real building row at London's Clerkenwell. This is a late Georgian townhouse, built around 1792-94. In my opinion quite typical of Georgian period
    townhouse in this part of London. Modest houses, but quite possibly intended for artisan / skilled worker family house. Something today we would call as the middle class, although back then there
    would have been servant's rooms in the dormer.


    Often the townhouses were divided in to rented room lodgings and this in my mind, I have made the BATs as low wealth residence and commerce buildings.


    Originally this was a six house row, but today only two remain. Other four has been demolished in 1950's to make room for nearby St James Church's garden. Two of the houses were renovated by the
    Islington Council. Houses were in bad shape and most of the outer walls were rebuilt. I have based my model on 1956 drawing, although I have made some simplifications. Thus the modern houses are
    slight different, for example the roof is different shape now.


    The corner houses are fictional, just based on my imagination and only with style are companions for the terrace row. As it is difficult to grow right corner combination, I offer the corner
    commercial buildings as ploppable version. So that a player can finish the terrace row with matching corner building. I have also included custom foundations, but I would not call these buildings
    slope friendly. These are tolerant for slight elevation, but do not function well in hilly region.

    Caution: The file has only the SC4 Models and Desc. Lots are not included.


    There has been a few request so here is HD Maxis night version of the Clerkenwell Close building pack. All the models are converted to Maxis night option. Stats are same and all files have
    desc.sc4 included. The props and the Main buildings.


    However, as noted above, I have not included the lots. So this is only for those of you who are willing to do extra effort to make lots themselves or use my Dark Night lots as template.

    This small wall-to-wall library is inspired by a real life building, Karl Marx Memorial Library, in Clerkenwell, London. This is no political statement, I just like its Georgian look and it fits
    into my current playstyle. There are not that many historical libraries for wall-to-wall urban environment, so I decided to create one.


    I have made two versions, a grey stucco functional education library and an additional red brick high wealth office building.


    The real life building is from Georgian era, built around 1769, but has been heavily modified during its life. It has served many functions, including as a shop. During 1980's the building was
    renovated and the original look was restored. This BAT is based on how facade looks today.


    HD model with Maxis and Dark Night version. Night versions share IDs, so if you have both versions in the city, those will most likely conflict. It has a custom foundation, so it is slope
    friendly.


    I have included in a 1x1 FAR angle option of the Library building. The FAR model is included in the file and perhaps someone can do a better lotting than I did.


    Simmer2 has been helpful with the lotting and he has provided a custom texture for the lots. The texture dat file is included in the download. Thank You Simmer2. The props are mostly HD to go with
    the HD BAT.
