    My British building journey continues. This time three stone building variations. Historic houses that can be found in Northern England and possibly in Scotland and Ireland. Two residences and one
    small commercial shop. These can be used in both rural and town environments as 1x2 lots are wall-to-wall buildings.


    The buildings and textures are based on Bilteezi railway model cardkits. This has helped me to get sizes and shapes right. Also, for some reason, Bilteezi texture suite well with HD. There are
    little ill effects even in level 5 zoom.
