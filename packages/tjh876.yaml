  description: >-
    Back again with my v2 of my modern realsitic subway station. V2 includes some features, like better textures, a redesigned elevator, plotable versions for not only roads, but avenues too. Both are
    UDI enabled, so it acts as a road/avenue, and a subway station. The model is similar to v1, but v2 has improved models, as well as textures, higher capacity and more realsitic ulitity usage, and
    improved lot layout. There is included installation instructions, as well as all dependencies are included. Here are some more details about each lot.


    Thanks for everyone's recomndations and support, as well as people who have gave me help in making these lots. Thanks to people who have tagged along in my BAT thread, and their support is
    escpeccially helpful. This lot is endorsed by the SImtropolis Transit BAT Team. Please do not upload these lots or any part of this upload without my permission and written approval. Thanks for
