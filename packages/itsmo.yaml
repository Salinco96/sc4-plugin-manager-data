    This is the second version of the ancient stone walls, the first version are ugly and incomplete. So I made a new version more original, prolix and complete with new parts for a better result. As
    an added benefit it are very flexible (with the pending) and it have intersections.


    It haven't a street, road and avenue gate because the structure is very simple and the rocks are very heavy (The people that allegedly builded this walls don't know how make a gate yet).


    **Monthly cost:**


    As this walls are or stone, no requires of maintenance, they are a giant mountain of rocks!


    **Build cost:** Is of 100 Simoleons.


    **List of pieces:** For a original result, I added more pieces:


    - 1x1 Lot


    - 2x1 Lot


    - The Corner


    - Stairs


    - A door


    - The shelter


    NOTE: Suposing that this walls are builded in the war, I made a shelter with provisions and a building for storage.


    ENJOY!
