    Historic Harbor is a comprehensive 'modular set' that includes over 1,000 BATed models, a wide assortment of MMPs, and over 100 individual lots (each with custom icons).


    We named it 'Historic Harbor' because it is supposed to represent what a harbor might look like in the late 19th century, but that doesn't mean it can't be used in conjunction with modern cities.
    Look around at many waterfront cities today and you will find traces from a bygone era.


    Everything included in this download has been hand crafted for use with this set and any future 'Historic' add-ons. We will be updating the *Historic Harbor - Dependencies* with additional
    props/textures/resource files in order to consolidate everything in one 'master' dependency.


    The set is broken down in an organized fashion, so users who are comfortable with customizing their setup may remove the lots that may not be used. For example you may not want to use any of the
    'Under Construction' lots - in that case simply remove the file 'Under Construction.dat' from the Lots folder and those will not show up in your menu when you start the game. If you are using lots
    from a category that you wish to remove, it is advisable to delete all instances of those lots before you remove them from your plugins folder (per standard SC4 operating procedure).


    Once installed, the lots will be at the end of the 'Seaport' menu. The lots will be grouped together in similar categories (Pier, Quay, Filler, etc.). Despite their organized appearance, the sheer
    number of lots will make for lots of scrolling, so if you are a DAMN user, it is recommended that you take advantage of that program for this set.


    A few stray lots will fall in their respected menu categories, such as the 'bus stop' and 'waste' lots (you will find this lot in the 'power' menu), but 99% of the lots will be in the 'Seaport'
    menu.


    **Gameplay:**


    For detailed instructions and example regarding the lots and MMPs, you will find everything you need in the 'readme' file located in both the *Historic Harbor - Lots* download and the *Historic
    Harbor - MMPs* download. We encourage everyone to browse through the readme - it contains loads of vital information and it looks really cool!


    **Known Bugs:**


    There are a number of known issues and visual glitches associated with these lots (although easily remedied) and the accompanying readme explains everything in detail. So once again - please read
    the readme!


    **Developer notes:**


    This is a massive set that has been years in the making. There has been a thorough testing of each piece, but that doesn't mean everything will work perfectly. If you run into any problems, please
    feel free to contact us (see 'Support' below).


    For additional information regarding tips, known bugs, and how-to examples, please consult the readme.


    Please do not distribute any Historic Harbor content without the developers consent.


    For those who wish to create lots using the models from this set, please feel free to download the 'prop catalog' - it will help sort through the thousands of props that are available.


    **Support:**


    For questions regarding this set, please feel free to visit **[this thread](https://community.simtropolis.com/topic/64293-historic-harbor-support-thread/)** here at Simtropolis.


    **Special Thanks:**


    Thanks goes out to all the folks over at SimPeg who were gracious enough to offer suggestions, ideas and criticism that made this set better than anything the three of us could pull off on our
    own.


    Specifically, we would like to thank our volunteer beta testers for graciously donating their time to go through this set and find all our mistakes:


    - mgb


    - Paeng


    - tariel


    - epicblunder


    - cmdp123789


    - Chris11


    - NielsC007


    - rathefalcon


    - Indiana Joe


    Also, we would like to acknowledge NBVC for providing the BAT script that allows custom LOD's to work at all zoom levels - it makes a world of difference when viewing the Historic Harbor pieces
    from afar.
