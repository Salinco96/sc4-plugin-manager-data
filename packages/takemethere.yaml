  description: Have you ever wanted to make a diagonal road tunnel? Well now you can! The base version is a functional tunnel with a capacity of 5000 and can be found in the transportation menu. The lot
    will convert road traffic into subway traffic and vice versa allowing you to create modular rail tunnels under any kind of terrain or development. Otherwise you can make use of it solely for
    cosmetic purposes. For some currently unknown reason car traffic will not use the tunnel, but it is passable by foot or bus. I recommend placing a bus station close by so that car users can
    'transfer' onto buses in order to pass through the tunnel. No dependencies are required.

    Have you ever wanted to properly end your power lines with a transformer substation? Well now you can! By previous request I'm releasing this file which I first displayed on my CJ a while back.
    Originally the plan was to include this lot as part of a set of several different types of transitions(1-line, 2-line, 2-way, 4-way etc.) for both the in-game maxis power lines and also
    MandelSoft's [custom power line set](http://i.imgur.com/1WnrSOH.jpg). However I've decided to abandon that much delayed project in favor of a completely new custom power line set I'm currently
    working on.


    This substation can be used to properly cap the beginning and end of your power lines using a couple of very simple BAT. The lot provides 400 units of power, the idea behind that being that while
    a substation doesn't actually generate power it plays an important part in prevent transmission power loses by stepping up and the reducing the voltages across a long distance power line. It can
    be found near the bottom of the power menu. No dependencies are required.


    **Stats:**


    Plop Cost: $400


    Power produced: 400 (8MW)


    Monthly Cost: $4


    Demolition cost: $100
