  description:
    Have you ever wanted to make a diagonal road tunnel? Well now you can! The base version is a functional tunnel with a capacity of 5000 and can be found in the transportation menu. The lot
    will convert road traffic into subway traffic and vice versa allowing you to create modular rail tunnels under any kind of terrain or development. Otherwise you can make use of it solely for
    cosmetic purposes. For some currently unknown reason car traffic will not use the tunnel, but it is passable by foot or bus. I recommend placing a bus station close by so that car users can
    'transfer' onto buses in order to pass through the tunnel. No dependencies are required.

    The 3rd release of the [Towers of Steel Project](https://community.simtropolis.com/journals/entry/26048-the-towers-of-steel-project/). The Mount Royal Candelabra Tower is a freestanding
    lattice tower located on Mount Royal in Montreal, Canada. Nearly all of Montreal's TV & radio stations broadcast from here hence the need for the candelabra(multi-platform) design. The tower is
    one of my shorter reproductions with an estimated height of 433ft/132m but it makes up for the lack of height by being quite detailed. The lot can be found at the bottom of the Landmark menu, some
    industrial high tech cap relief is also provided.

    This is the updated 3ds HD version of the [3rd release](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30562-mount-royal-candelabra-tower/) of the [Towers of Steel
    Project](https://community.simtropolis.com/journals/entry/27107-towers-of-steel-revisited/#comments). The Mount Royal Transmission Tower is a freestanding lattice tower located on "Mount Royal" in
    Montreal, Canada. Nearly all of Montreal's TV & radio stations broadcast from here hence the need for a candelabra(multi-platform) design. The actual height of the tower in the real world is not
    publicized but I've estimated it at approximately 433ft/132m(including transmitters). It is one of the shorter towers but imo it makes up for the lack of height by being very detailed. The lot can
    be found at the bottom of the Landmark menu. Some industrial high tech cap relief is also provided.


    Three versions of the tower are available. This each versions has a different paint scheme. However, rather than having separate lots for each version I've instead used a prop family. Meaning,
    each time you plop the lot you have a 33% change of getting a particular paint scheme. Additionally, the AWL(air craft warning lights) are low intensity night lights made in 3ds rather than the
    previously used maxis red blinking props.

    Have you ever wanted to properly end your power lines with a transformer substation? Well now you can! By previous request I'm releasing this file which I first displayed on my CJ a while back.
    Originally the plan was to include this lot as part of a set of several different types of transitions(1-line, 2-line, 2-way, 4-way etc.) for both the in-game maxis power lines and also
    MandelSoft's [custom power line set](http://i.imgur.com/1WnrSOH.jpg). However I've decided to abandon that much delayed project in favor of a completely new custom power line set I'm currently
    working on.


    This substation can be used to properly cap the beginning and end of your power lines using a couple of very simple BAT. The lot provides 400 units of power, the idea behind that being that while
    a substation doesn't actually generate power it plays an important part in prevent transmission power loses by stepping up and the reducing the voltages across a long distance power line. It can
    be found near the bottom of the power menu. No dependencies are required.


    **Stats:**


    Plop Cost: $400


    Power produced: 400 (8MW)


    Monthly Cost: $4


    Demolition cost: $100
