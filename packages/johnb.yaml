    Finally realistic desert regions are possible!!! This mod consists of 3 different types of saguaro cacti. Large cactus, Small cactus, Cactus with 3 arms at different height. These cacti can be
    placed as flora in mayor mode. The plop cost is 5 sim dollars.


    I would like to thank Gizmo28 for all the hard work in making the cacti into flora. I would also like to thank DarkMatter for helping me and giving me advice on how to best make the Saguaros. I am
    hoping to see some desert CJ's made with these cacti. Enjoy!!!


    Here is a link to the latest desert terrain mod by Thalassicus.It's based on the mod by Teirusu, but gives you even more terrain styles to choose from. No desert region is complete without it.
    It's truly the best. [Link to mod](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/index.cfm?id=4483)
