    This is a set of growable homes inspired by SC2013.

    They come in 15 different color variations and sit on a total of 15 lots.

    A custom building foundation has been created (including nightlights), so the lots are slope-friendly. A foundation will extend on a slopy terrain.

    Each lot comes with the house as a prop family (separated only into color and neutral) to enhance variety.

    There are lots for the colorfuls and lots for the neutrals, so you can choose to use either or both at the same time.

    Available in Maxis night and DarkNite. You can only use one version at a time!

    The lots come in different sizes in growth stages 1 - 4.

    Tileset: New York & Chicago

    Credits: T Wrecks & SimCoug for testing

    Special thanks to SimCoug, Aaron Graham and over at SC4D to callagrafx and c.p. for their help during the foundation creation process
