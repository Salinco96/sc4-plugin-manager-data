    Left behind and forgotten by an ancient unknown civilization on our Simplanet way before today's Simkind arrived, Sims finally figured out how to make this power generating machine function and
    make good use it. Inspired by the Ice Planet Basecamp-Generator from Star Wars' Empire Strikes Back, Nexis brings you another unique, useful and simple BAT. The **Nexis Mega-Generator** produces
    powerful electricity by melting **Hydro-monoxide molecule leftovers** without any pollution at all and at a very low maintenance cost, therefore the need to connect it to your watersystems is very
    important and absolutely necessary. Unfortunetly it uses quite a lot of water while functioning, but gives you back enormous amounts of very clean energy, some 30,000 MWts.


    Plop price is $8,500


    Bulldozing will cost you $250


    Power 30,000


    Need of water 200


    Lotsize 2x5


    Ploppable only in places where approved by the Governor.......


    ...and btw like some other \*strange energy-producing uploads\*, this one doesn't explode.... (used and molten molecules will be sold at the Nexis Garden Center as a flowering fertilizer called
    \*Miracle-Glow\*....please do not swallow)


    The unzipped Nexisfolder (incl the 2 game-files) should go into the **MyDocuments/ Simcity4/ Plugins** folder. Do not include the Readme and the pictures.


    You will find this BAT in the Powermenu.


    Again, the need of dependencies except the basic »**Maxis bldgprop 1+2 «** , is eliminated with Nexis BATs/Lots. Keep your plugins free of dependencies and your game will run faster and better,
    therefor more fun.


    Please DO NOT redistribute these files without my permission and sell my inventions to strangers.


    Please don't ask me how exactly this hydro-monoxide molecule melting processus works in detail, all I know is what the Sims told me, thanks.


    **Have Fun with Nexis.**


    To see what's coming next and maybe throw in some of your ideas and always useful help (that doesn't mean I BAT on demand though), come see and encourage me
    in[THIS](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=37&threadid=97994&STARTPAGE=5)thread for my **BATs** and
    in[THIS](https://www.simtropolis.com/forum/messageview.cfm?catid=42&threadid=92611&STARTPAGE=9) thread for my **LOTs**.
