    This is a DLL for SimCity 4 that adds a few more cheat codes beyond [Buggi's Extra Cheats DLL](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/).

    - **SievertBeGone** — removes all radiation from a city, including from buildings that produce radiation when plopped (such as the advanced research center).
    - **Chernobyl** — irradiates an entire city
    - **hazmat** — creates a toxic spill disaster on whatever tile the mouse is pointed at
    - **UncivilDisobedience** — creates a riot disaster on whatever tile the mouse is pointed at. The mouse must be pointed at a road, street or avenue tile.

    The development thread can be found at [this link](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/70495-game-framework-compatible-dll-loading-and-other-modding-discoveries/). Source code can be found [here](https://github.com/nsgomez/gzcom-dll/blob/master/gzcom-dll/src/cGZExtraExtraCheatsDllDirector.cpp). Make sure to follow this file in case more cheats are added!

simmaster07/sc4fix:

    **What does this do?**

    - Fixes a serialization bug that could corrupt the savegame, particularly when mods are installed that modify existing exemplars (i.e. [Prop Pox](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/74667-revisiting-prop-pox-and-prop-theory/)).
    - Resolves a crash-to-desktop when hovering NAM puzzle pieces over transit-enabled lots.
    - Allows other DLLs to load into SC4's memory without a GZCOM framework.

    To see if SC4Fix is working properly, check the title of your game window. If you are playing in fullscreen mode, alt-tab out and hover over the SimCity taskbar icon. The titlebar will show "SC4Fix (version #)" if loaded properly.

    **Repairing cities already affected by Prop Pox**

    Thanks to *kingofsimcity* for [these instructions](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/74667-revisiting-prop-pox-and-prop-theory/?do=findComment&comment=1687198):

    1.  In the region view, open the graphics settings and change **City Detail** to **Low**.
    2.  Close and relaunch SC4.
    3.  Open the offending city tile and save immediately.
    4.  Exit to region without saving and change City Detail back to **High**.
    5.  Close and relaunch SC4.
    6.  Open the offending city tile and save again.

    **Demonstration**

simmaster07/upgradeable-city-halls:
  categories: gameplay,dll
  description: |-
    **This mod may not be compatible with the "[All 3 CityHalls Modd Reward fix](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/11154-all-3-cityhalls-modd-reward-fix/)". This plugin is intended to supersede that file's behavior.**

    This is a DLL for SimCity 4 that makes the City Hall reward upgradeable. Instead of implementing the three City Hall stages as separate reward lots, this mod implements Maxis' originally intended behavior of actually replacing the City Hall lot as new stages are unlocked. It also prompts the user with advisor messages asking if they want to upgrade the reward, just like the airport upgrade behavior.

    This mod is part of my effort to deconstruct the internal game interfaces. The development thread can be found at [this link](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/70495-game-framework-compatible-dll-loading-and-other-modding-discoveries/). Source code is [over here](https://github.com/nsgomez/gzcom-dll/blob/f30177d86f56a901e9662c1e63942a9f3a4e2dee/gzcom-dll/src/cGZCityHallUpgradeDllDirector.cpp).

    **Behavior**

    The user is prompted monthly to upgrade to stage 2 when the city's population reaches 45,000, and to upgrade to stage 3 at 95,000. The mod also adds a cheat code, "UpgradeCityHall," that forces the upgrade prompt to appear regardless of population.

    **Installation**

    Unzip to your plugins folder.

    - On Windows and Mac versions *other than the App Store*, this is in Documents\\SimCity 4\\Plugins.
    - On the Mac App Store version, this is in ~/Library/Containers/com.aspyr.simcity4.appstore/Data/Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.

    Create these directories if they do not exist yet.

    **Mac users**

    You must install [SC4MacInjector](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/32047-sc4macinjector-a-dynamic-code-plugin-loader-for-mac/) before using this mod or else nothing will happen.

    **Compatibility**

    Tested and working on 1.1.641.0 (Steam/GOG/Origin) on Windows and the Steam version of SC4 for Mac. Also works in combination with [SC4Fix](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30883-sc4fix-third-party-patches-for-sc4/) and the [Extra Cheats DLL](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/). Untested but should work with any version of SimCity 4 Deluxe or SimCity 4 w/ Rush Hour.
