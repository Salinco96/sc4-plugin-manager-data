    This upload has become now the **official release of the Real RailWay (RRW) Reskin 3rd Party Lot Support** and it is replacing the former and by now obsolete *NCD-BSC RealRailway Texture Pack by
    eggman121 and rivit* (**both the older V1 and recently made V2 update has become superseded by this update**)


    This is the updated version of the original *NCD Real Railway Texture Override Pack by eggman121*, as the original one became a bit outdated. This update contains the more coherent and up to date
    version of the RRW Reskin 3rd party Lot Supports by rivit, MGB and eggman121. The original files were replaced with the Reskin Kit LotSupport versions and the install folder is now identical with
    the RRW Reskin folder. Bear in mind this override set is only compatible with the original RealRailway (brownish) texture set. For alternative colour re-skins use the RRW Reskin Kit.


    In order to make the RRW Reskin (a project to enable the recoloring of the Real Railway) a set of Lot Textures has been created for the Original RRW texture colours. With the help of a number of
    modders (spotting, making and testing) a very comprehensive coverage has been achieved - roughly 1100 textures.


    Older lot textures were made with the Maxis Rail in mind. This set contains RRW versions of those textures. They will not be perfect as they have been algorithmically redrawn. However they match
    in color, guage and positioning.


    If when using them you discover very poor quality please let us know so we can fix them.


    The Set contains support for Rail Textures for lots using textures by the following authors:


    NAM core, BSC (incl jes), Cogeo, MGB, PEG, NCD, NOB, APTX, Simmer2 and WMP sets of Lot Textures containing Rail.

        **RealRailway_ReSkin_LotSupport_NCD.dat**
    2.  *Various rail related textures (most of them) that can be found in the [BSC Textures
    packs](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/3-sc4d-lex-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack "BSC Common Dependencies")*

    Vol01.dat](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/142-aptx-ultra-prop-pack)

        **RealRailway_ReSkin_LotSupport_APTX.dat**

    Vol01_v2.dat](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/11-sc4d-lex-legacy-nob-dependencies-pack) (former Ftextures)

    "PEG-MTP SUPER PACK")

        **RealRailway_ReSkin_LotSupport_PEG.dat**\*\*\*
    8.  *Various rail related textures from Simmer2. Simmer2 has already created his textures for RRW in mind, but used custom colours, wearing etc.. These Reskin overrides in this DAT are transition
    textures between his RRW textures and whatever RRW Reskin is in use by the player.*

        **RealRailway_ReSkin_LotSupport_Simmer2.dat**
    9.  *Various rail related textures created by the WMP Team, that can be found in the* [WMP Mega Textures v1.02](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/33626-wmp-mega-textures-v102/ "STEX").

    10. *These are the rail related lot support textures that came with the base game or added by the* *Network Addon Mod*.

        **RealRailway_ReSkin_LotSupport_CORE.dat**\*\*\*\*

    \*The *Rail Yard and Spur Textures Mega Pack 1* on STEX is an outdated legacy texture set. It is highly NOT recommended to be used for LOT making. **Use instead the NCD Railyard Texture Mega-Pack
    Vol01 v3**.


    \*\*The BSC Texture Packs are part of the BSC Common Dependencies Pack and they are still needed since only the rail related textures were updated! So Please keep these file in


    your plugins folder!


    \*\*\*The *RealRailway_ReSkin_LotSupport_PEG.dat* is (more or less) identical with the *PEG\-SUPER_TEXTURES_RRWOverride.dat* that was released with the [Pegasus CDK3
    Collection](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35353-pegasus-cdk3-collection/).


    \*\*\*\*A more or less identical version of this file (*RealRailway_Textures_LotSupport.dat*) can also be found in the [Network Addon
    Mod](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/6-network-addon-mod-nam/2-network-addon-mod).


    This update is highly recommended for anyone who is using the Real Railway and wishes for NCD Lots to conform


    ### Change Log


    - The former *NCD-BSC RealRailway Texture Pack by eggman121 and rivit* (both the older V1 and recently made V2 update has become superseded by this upload, which is the official **Real RailWay
    (RRW) Reskin 3rd Party Lot Support**

    - The **APTX** files are the latest addition (found by Tyberius06)

    - the **jes** files have been merged into the BSC files (req. Tyberius06)

    - a number of **NCD102** textures have received corrected IIDs (found by Tyberius06)

    - The **RealRailway_ReSkin_LotSupport_PEG.dat** now has become (more or less) identical with the *PEG\-SUPER_TEXTURES_RRWOverride.dat* that was released with the [Pegasus CDK3
    Collection](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35353-pegasus-cdk3-collection/)


    as a consequence of these changes, both versions have changed (from v2.47 to v3.48) and previous installs should be removed first before putting this in place.
