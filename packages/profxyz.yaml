    (After "leeching" from Simtropolis for so long I thought it might be time to actually try and make something myself...so I thought this rather simple structure might be a good way of getting to
    grips with the BAT. Thanks for the people who wrote the BATing tutorials in the Omnibus!)


    [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenotaph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cenotaph)


    Cenotaphs are best known as memorials, built mainly by the British Empire and the Commonwealth dominions, to commemorate the war dead of World War One.


    This particular cenotaph is based on the one in Hong Kong. However, the light texture of the memorial itself bears a greater resemblance to the one in London (which was the basis for the Hong Kong
    Cenotaph anyway).


    As this is my first ever attempt, please tell me if there is something I should have/could have done better. Sorry in advance for the mediocre wreaths...if anyone has any tips with that it would
    be greatly appreciated. Sorry also for not being able to render the words "THE GLORIOUS DEAD"...
