    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the BSC-assembled prop packs of popular Japanese BATer ks_jpn, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion. After battling a
    number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these
    dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    **CHANGE LOG**


    - 20.01.2024 - Update to Version 2


    - Official update in the installer itself


    - Some small adjustments and clean-ups in the prop packs and within the upload

    - ks_jpn MEGA Props Vol04 has been updated to v2 as the Jade Hotel model had to be pulled out. That model is not a ks_JPN creation (as it turned out recently), but it is Raika's (another Japanese
    BATter) creation that was released almost 20 years ago with the Freyman Hotel upload. The said model is/will be available in the SC4D LEX Legacy - Raika Dependency Collection V1, shortly.

    - ks_jpn MEGA Props Vol11 has been updated to v2 after it received a recently recovered model; the Christmas version of the Akasaka Prince Hotel

    - ks_jpn MEGA Props Vol14 has been updated to v2 after the included LTUArena-001_text.dat had to be updated as the the texture inside the DAT used a dummy and conflicting ID based on the provided
    test range by the SC4Tool. The corresponding lot will be updated with the new texture ID.


    **Installation**


    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.


    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\--or a zip tool capable
    of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org), and for macOS, use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).


    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything).
    Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). On the Cleanup tab, click "Start scan" to find any
    outdated files that currently reside in your Plugins folder that may conflict with this package. Clicking "Backup" will remove these old files to a safe location. (The option to "Delete" them also
    exists, but is not recommended.)\*\* After this, click over to the Install tab, and click "Start installation" to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a
    message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.


    \*\* Though there is an inbuilt cleanitol function in the installer, at this point it is not working entirely properly so it is highly recommended to run the individual cleanitol files or the
    master cleanitol for the compilation with one of the following 3rd party cleanitol tools:


    [nos.17 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/) (new tool)


    BSC Cleanitol (old tool)

    This package has been made possible by the Project ZIP efforts of Tyberius06, and was assembled by Tarkus. Previous Prop Pack assembly performed by members of the BSC.
