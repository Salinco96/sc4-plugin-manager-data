    **Description**


    This is a pack of japanese “w2w” growable lots for your dense urban environments, their style makes them look great in any kind of city, not just asian ones. I've taken these building models,
    given them new stats, put them in lots and even combined some of them together to achieve that dense, built-up look of a modern downtown.


    **Installation**


    Just unzip the folder with the lot files anywhere in your Plugins directory. It's recommended to keep the folder structure intact to help maintain your content organized.


    Don't extract the Documentation files to your Plugins folder!


    **Uninstallation**


    Make sure you bulldoze every instance of these buildings you may have in your cities. After that, remove the files from your Plugins folder.


    **Dependencies**


    Make sure you have all the files in your Plugins, if you don't, you will get brown boxes instead of the actual buildings and some textures could also be missing.

    **Notes**


    I did not make the model(s) and do not claim any credit for them. The modding of this buildings was made using the PIM\-X tool, so there shouldn't be any problem with these buildings throwing the
    game off balance.


    If you run into any issues, or want to see other things I'm working on, pay a visit to my lot thread in Simtropolis, you can also PM me here.


    Enjoy!
