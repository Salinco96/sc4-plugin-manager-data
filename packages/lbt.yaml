    This **LBT Mega Texture Pack vol01** **v03** is a "legacy-like" overall collection of the different LBT texture sets to support the already released lots. Since it's unlikely that the now-retired
    LBT team would go through on their released lots which still have the old textures with the old ID's, this compilation is supposed to cover those rare cases too.


    As part of the **Project ZIP** efforts the \*exe installer has been removed from this texture pack\*\*\*


    This is a complete set of textures, for future LBT releases, this file replaces all LBT old texture packs as like:


    *LBT Texture Pack 01*


    *LBT texture pack 02*


    *LBTtexts.dat* (part of the LBT Prop Pack vol01)


    Install: copy/extract the **LBT** parent folder into your plugins. If you extracted the *\_Documents* folder into your plugins, too, it's highly recommended to keep it, but move it out of the
    Plugins folder.


    Textures made and configured by:


    \-Victor Gonzales


    \-Heblem


    \*\*\*Bear in mind, that this version is identical with the updated version of the **[LBT Mega Textures vol01 v3 on SC4D LEX](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=4153)** (as
    of 21.06.2022).
