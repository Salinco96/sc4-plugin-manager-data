    This is a Dutch themed prop pack. About 100 props, including colour variations and diagonals. You can give your lots or modds a Dutch theme with these. Various stuff like trash cans, paid-parking
    machines, glass recycle containers and phone booths. I guess the pictures speak for themselves.


    I intended them to be used in shopping centres, parks, plaza's, parkings, highways, roads, street-modds, busstops, bicycle-paths, rest-area's or residential-lots. Maybe you will even find a
    different use for them.


    All models are made by me, and all are in HD. Only a couple of decals are from the internet.


    Well, if anything is wrong with the files in the upload, just leave a comment here or PM me. For more info on my stuff you can also visit here:
