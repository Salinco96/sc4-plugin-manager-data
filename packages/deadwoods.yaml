    Want public transport in your congested cities, but hate giving up valuable realestate to monorail or elevated rail. This set of lots combine elevated rail with commercial services (CS$) providing
    jobs for your sims in a series of brick arch style shops and workshops. Each is network enabled, so just plop and run the rail over it. The lots feature prop a prop family for the shopfronts, so a
    different combination will appear each time one of them is plopped.


    This package contains four plopable lots; one 3 tiles wide (in the direction of the rail), one four tiles wide, one five tiles wide and one six tiles wide. All the lots are one tile deep, so you
    could have parallel rail lines running. Because the lots are network enabled they cannot be joined end-to-end; there must be a one tile gap (perhaps for a road). They are also very gradient
    sensitive. If you want to join a string of them together you should level the area first.


    These lots are not the same as simrolle's sbahhoff lots. His are are plopped on either side of a rail line (or elevated road) with the rail running down the middle. These are single lots that
    include the relevant rail. His are three tiles deep whereas these are one tile deep. His have special lots to include roads/avenues. These do not.


    These lots are BSC BTE enabled. This means they will contribute to reward chains. Having enough of these in your city may entitle you to specific rewards.


    * * *


    This is Version 3 (v103). All the lots have been updated with SC4PIM-X (x-tool), some underlying issues have been fixed and the contents have got the "Project ZIP" threatment. The IDs remained the
    same in this pack.


    This v103 version (released as an update on STEX) will be equivalent with the version that is/will be released on SC4Evermore as part of the SC4D LEX Legacy compilations.


    In all cases players who has previous versions installed of these lots are required to bulldoze these lots in their cities and remove them from their plugins folder before installing this update.
    For removing old versions you need to run the included cleanitol scrip with the [nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/) or with the [BSC
    Cleanitol TM](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/18-bsc-cleanitol) tool.

    # DEDWD Small Shops 1x1 Pack


    by deadwoods


    This package contains a set of small shops on 1x1 lots. I noticed a distinct lack of unique buildings in this space provided by Maxis (Simgoober has created some great 1x1 lots). The buildings on
    these lots are based on brick shops found in many of the older (early 20th Century) suburbs in Australia. However the style is very common and can be found in many places worldwide. I've seen
    shops like these in small towns in the USA.


    There are two buildings in this set; a single storey one and a double storey one. Each one has different roof and plumbing texture combinations, so there are actually a dozen models. The buildings
    are in building families so they appear randomly. The shopfronts are provided by the shop front props in the ~~DEDWD_SmallShops_Props pack~~ **[BSC MEGA Props DEDWD/DAE
    Vol02](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/13153-bsc-mega-props-dae-vol02/).** With the combination of building models and storefront props there are about 800 possible combinations
    providing a bit of variety to your cities.


    There are also CS$ and CS$$ varieties of each. So there are four lots in all.


    These lots are BSC BTE enabled. This means they will contribute to reward chains. Having enough of these in your city may entitle you to specific rewards.


    * * *


    This is Version 3 (v103). All the lots have been updated with SC4PIM-X (x-tool), some underlying issues have been fixed and the contents have got the "Project ZIP" threatment. The IDs remained the
    same in this pack.


    This v103 version (released as an update on STEX) will be equivalent with the version that is/will be released on SC4Evermore as part of the SC4D LEX Legacy compilations.


    In all cases players who have previous versions installed of these lots are required to bulldoze these lots in their cities and remove them from their plugins folder before installing this update.
    For removing old versions you need to run the included cleanitol scrip with the **[nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/)** or with the **[BSC

  description: >-
    This package contains a set of small shops on 1x1 and 1x2 lots. After the first set of Small Shops, I had a request for a flat roofed set (as is more common in the US). So here they are. There are
    five buildings in this set; two single storey and three double storey one. The shopfronts are provided by the shop front props in the ~~DEDWD_SmallShops_Props pack~~ **[BSC MEGA Props DEDWD/DAE
    Vol02](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/13153-bsc-mega-props-dae-vol02/)**. With the combination of building models and storefront props there are hundreds of possible combinations
    providing a bit of variety to your cities. You can use these lots in conjunction with the other sets of Small Shops (the 1x1 and 1x2 sets).


    There are also CS$ and CS$$ varieties of each. So there are eight lots in all (~~these are the same lots as the other sets~~**\*\*** I've just added some more buildings to the same building
    families).


    These lots are BSC BTE enabled. This means they will contribute to reward chains. Having enough of these in your city may entitle you to specific rewards.


    This is Version 3 (v103). All the lots have been updated with SC4PIM-X (x-tool), some underlying issues have been fixed and the contents have got the "Project ZIP" threatment.


    **\*\*The Instance IDs for the lots have been changed in this set**, because they shared the same IDs as the other two DEDWD Small Shops Sets. This update therefore brings 8 unique lot files that
    can be used with or without the other two sets.


    This v103 version (released as an update on STEX) will be equivalent with the version that is/will be released on SC4Evermore as part of the SC4D LEX Legacy compilations.


    In all cases players who has previous versions installed of these lots are required to bulldoze these lots in their cities and remove them from their plugins folder before installing this update.
    For removing old versions you need to run the included cleanitol scrip with the **[nos.17's SC4 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/)** or with the **[BSC
    Cleanitol TM](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/18-bsc-cleanitol)** tool.

  description: >-
    This download contains a set of highway noise barrier walls. Whilst being of a simple and cheap concrete and steel design, they have a more pleasing curved pattern look as seems to be the trend in
    a lot of road construction these days.


    They are modded to provide a very healthy Park and Landmark effect, so the sims living and working near them will appreciate it. They also have a significant pollution reduction factor, so even
    though they can't reduce the sim traffic noise, they can remove the pollution affects assoicated with them. Plop a few of these beside a highway, avenue or road and see the positive effect they
    have on the surrounding buildings.


    There are ten lots in the set; some straight, some with corners, some diagonal and some overhanging the lot to cover those blank tiles beside the on/off ramps that you can never use.


    The lots all have the base texture removed, so the ground texture underneath will show through. This is good as the highways don't have a texture under them, so the lots match. But the lots
    sometime suffer from the "missing base" bug where the base appears blue/black.


    I'm working on a Menu Management Lot (MML) mod for these, so they don't clutter up the Misc Transport menu when you don't need them. These lots are BSC Tracking Enabled (BTE) which means they may
    contribute to Reward Chains.

  description: >-
    Welcome to deadwoods' Large School Set. A series of school lots to grow as your rural areas grow into cities. There are three lots in the setwith increasing student capacities that you "upgrade"
    to as you need to.


    I had originally intended to make the upgrades work like the Maxis airports, but the upgrade mechanism is built into the game. Instead, I have created three lots of the same size (7x6) all based
    around some anchor buildings (a small schoolhouse, a gym and toilet block). Each of the three stages have different lot layouts and student capacities. All three lots have 4x the coverage of the
    small elementary school. All three lots also provide education for both elementary (primary or K-6) and high (secondary or 7-12) students.


    The stages are:


    - **Stage 1** - Designed for a rural community with a small school and some paddocks where students can learn animal and farming skills. This has a capacity for 750 students.

    - **Stage 2** - Designed for a small-medium town or a growing suburb. The main buildings are the same, but the increased capacity has been filled by portable classrooms (portables). A soccer field
    has been added for sport and a better carpark introduced. This has a capacity for 1500 students.

    - **Stage 3** - Designed for large town or medium/high density suburb. A large 28-classroom building has been added for increased capacity (now 3000 students). This school runs night Adult
    Education classes and so also helps the education level of adults.


    These lots do not automatically upgrade. When you find one starting to reach capacity, you should bulldoze it and plop the next stage lot. You may need to tweak the funding settings to get the new
    school equivalent to the previous one. The bulldoze costs for the Stage1 and Stage2 schools is zero. The plop cost of the Stage2 and Stage3 schools is lower than you would expect as it's an
    incremental cost.


    These lots are BSC Tracking Enabled (BTE) which means they may contribute to Reward Chains.


    Please see the readme for all technical details and dependencies.


    Thanks to the BSC for assistance with development and testing of these lots.

deadwoods/dedwd-sunken-plazas-mall-set:
  authors:

  category: parks
  description: >-
    This pack contains a series of sunken plaza lots. These subterranean malls are found in many cities, often connecting subways.


    There are five lots in the set; one with a set of stairs/escalators leading down to the mall, two open (one with jobs), and two with a pyramidal glass roof over the mall (again one with jobs). You
    can string these together to create a mall.


    Apart from the two lots with jobs, these are merely eye-candy, modded the same as the Maxis plazas. The two lots with jobs must be placed beside a network tile (e.g. street, road) otherwise you
    will get no-job zots.


    These lots are BSC Tracking Enabled (BTE) which means they may contribute to Reward Chains.
