toroca/5x5-and-6x6-malls:
  category: cs$$,cs$$$
  description: |-
    This collection of ten lots allows every shopping mall in the game to appear on 5x5 and 6x6 lots. Previously, no mall in the game could appear on a 5x5 lot, and only Andrews Fashion Center and Lee Shopping Mall would appear on 6x6 lots.

    All of the lots included are mainly altered versions of the lots some of the malls could already appear on, but they should be different enough not to be repetitive.

    Using these lots, you should be able to control where any of the malls can appear with more precision than before. Simply zone a 5x5 lot or 6x6 lot and you're guaranteed to get a mall on it.

  description: |-
    Many users of my [Industry Quadrupler](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21293-industry-quadrupler/) have requested a similar mod for Commercial Services. I originally created this mod almost seven years ago , but apparently never uploaded it here at Simtropolis, so I'm correcting that oversight now.

    This mod allows you to double the number of jobs in all commercial service buildings, and I've provided alternates that allow you to triple the jobs from the largest ones and quadruple the jobs in the malls. The service buildings in the game are a little closer to reality in jobs provided than the industrial buildings were, so I didn't see a need to quadruple them all. As always with my mods, see the included readme file for full details.

    I have no plans to do a similar mod for commercial office; there is no need since the capacities of the office buildings are much more in line with reality.

toroca/functional-landmarks:
  category: gameplay,overrides
  description: |-
    This mod allows you to add jobs to any or all of the Maxis-Made Landmarks, at your own discretion. Your sims can now work in buildings like the Empire State Building, Living Mall, or US Capitol. The buildings still function just like they used to, the only change is the addition of jobs.

    This mod adds jobs to any or all of the landmarks in the game, depending on which files you choose to utilize. The jobs created by landmarks will reduce that type of commercial demand accordingly, and they will appear in the Jobs and Population graph as well. Sims can now commute to these buildings for work. Other than the addition of jobs, these landmarks will work EXACTLY like the original versions. They still come with a significant plop cost, they still have the same positive effects on the surrounding area, and they still require a monthly maintenance fee. The ONLY change I've made to them is the addition of jobs to make them functional, because I hated paying good money for a building that did little more than sit there.

    **Important notes:**

    There are some MAJOR things to keep in mind with this mod.

    First and most importantly, there are some steps to be taken before installing or removing this mod. If you currently have landmarks in ANY of your cities, you MUST demolish them before you can install this mod. If you don't, you will not be able to enter any cities with landmarks already in them, because the game will crash to the desktop. The same goes for removing the mod. If you build any landmarks with jobs but then decide you no longer want the mod, you MUST demolish them before you uninstall the mod, or you will again not be able to enter any cities with them.

    Secondly, and almost as important, this mod is NOT compatible with any other Landmark Mods! If you wish to use this mod, you must first remove any landmark mods you may already have.

    Third, installing this mod will make the landmarks require road access. If they don't have access to a road, they will abandon. This is important because it affects all of them! If there are some landmarks you don't want to require road access (such as the Hollywood Sign, perhaps), you will need to pick and choose the ones you want to have jobs, one by one.

    Fourth, since they now provide jobs, they require workers! You can safely expect some of the skyscraper landmarks to deteriorate if you plop them in a region that only has a few thousand people, because the bigger landmarks now provide thousands of jobs! Use some common sense when placing them!

toroca/industry-quadrupler:
  category: gameplay,cheats
  description: |-
    This mod was created to make the industrial buildings more realistic in the game. As everyone knows, factories in fact employ hundreds or thousands of people, but in SimCity 4 there is hardly a single operation that offers more than 100 jobs. The number of jobs is quadrupled with the installation of this mod.

    All heavy, manufacturing and high-tech industries now offer four times the number of jobs. This means that the largest industrial building in the game now provides over 600 instead of just over 150 jobs. Filler buildings (burners, small warehouses, etc.) still have the old values, and I have only modified the larger industrial (anchor) buildings. In addition, I have doubled the amount of revenue of the modified buildings. Otherwise, with the increased number of jobs, industrial demand can be met more quickly, making it difficult to keep industrial cities afloat.

    In order to make this mod effective, you have to load all the cities of your region(s) after the installation and save them once, otherwise the changes in the job number will not take effect. After opening a city, the demand for industry will most likely fall sharply and many industrial buildings will be abandoned. On the other hand, the demand for residential areas will sooner or later increase sharply due to the increased number of jobs. It is therefore advisable to remove a large part of the industrial zones after loading the cities, so as not to overbalance the game.

    This download is compatible with all versions of SimCity 4.
