  description: Thanks to geoffhaw, I have created a texture set similar to the BSC ones. This set of 63 new base textures will be a dependency for many NDEX lots - and also updated versions of
    previously-released lots. Any lot designer is free to utilize these creations, but the DAT file is not to be included within the download; instead, please link to this upload (use the link
