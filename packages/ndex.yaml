    update: 20.06.2022 - folder structure unifying update to give this upload the same universal set-up as it can be found on SC4D LEX. 


    Installation: copy/extract the **NDEX** parent folder into your Plugins. If you extracted the _\_Documents_ folder into your plugins, too, it's highly recommended to keep it, but move it out of
    the Plugins folder.

    Thanks to geoffhaw, I have created a texture set similar to the BSC ones.  This set of 63 new base textures will be a dependency for many NDEX lots - and also updated versions of
    previously-released lots.  Any lot designer is free to utilize these creations, but the DAT file is not to be included within the download; instead, please link to this upload (use the link
    [https://www.simtropolis.com/STEX/details.cfm?id=11617](https://www.simtropolis.com/stex/details.cfm?id=11617)). 


    **Updated on 2/13/2005: replaced some of the less useful textures with far better and improved ones, changed IDs, added \[28\] textures extracted from The Sims 2.  You will not need to re-download
    older lots due to this update.  (for the most part, I only changed IDs of textures I have not yet used).**  I also changed the base texture dat's filename, because the comma was making it
    impossible for some people to extract both files.

    _This texture set is in its final form now; all bugs are removed, and all of the textures are ultra-high-quality and look very good in the game.  I apologize for the inconvenience of updating this
    file so many times, but I'd rather just have one texture dependency on future uploads, rather than 2 separate sets._


    * * *


    **In order to use this set, all you need to do is drop the two DAT files into your Program Files plugins folder.  They're located (most likely) at the bottom of the base texture list in the lot
    editor.**
