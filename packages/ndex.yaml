    Thanks to geoffhaw, I have created a texture set similar to the BSC ones. This set of 63 new base textures will be a dependency for many NDEX lots - and also updated versions of
    previously-released lots. Any lot designer is free to utilize these creations, but the DAT file is not to be included within the download; instead, please link to this upload (use the link
    https://www.simtropolis.com/STEX/details.cfm?id=11617).



    This texture set is in its final form now; all bugs are removed, and all of the textures are ultra-high-quality and look very good in the game. I apologize for the inconvenience of updating this
    file so many times, but I'd rather just have one texture dependency on future uploads, rather than 2 separate sets.


    In order to use this set, all you need to do is drop the two DAT files into your Program Files plugins folder. They're located (most likely) at the bottom of the base texture list in the lot
    editor.
