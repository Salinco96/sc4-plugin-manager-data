    In 1925, Andrew D. Rean, a local researcher, found traces of an ancient aquatic llama civilization, sparking world-wide llamamania. This branch of your local library system is named in his honor,
    and holds a special section devoted to the aquatic llama, where A. D. Rean can often be found boosting his ego.


    This is a medium sized library. Its characteristics are in between the Small Library and Main City Library from the game.


    Please read the readme for more information.

    Frosch Elementary is an elementary school with a slightly greater capacity than the Large Elementary School found in the game.


    - 5x4 elementary school lot.

    - MaxisNite and DarkNite night versions.

    - DarkNite requires the [Day and Nite Modd](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/).


    ![frosch-02.jpg.03c2eb8103206c2052dc8f15fa](https://www.simtropolis.com/repository/screens/monthly_2017_02/frosch-02.jpg.03c2eb8103206c2052dc8f15fae425c7.jpg)


    This is an adaptation of a non-SimCity project, an elementary school designed for a triangular site in Ypsilanti, Michigan.


    The first render shows the main entrance and covered student waiting area, mural, and the relationship with the street.


    The second render shows the playground. Train tracks are to the left, a small downtown is behind, and a neighborhood is to the right. The low brick volume is the gym/cafeteria/auditorium, which is
    in the basement along with the library.


    Across from train tracks that run next to the site, there is a municipal parking lot and Frog Island park which has large sports fields.

    **Installation Instructions:**


    1.  Download either the DarkNite (DN) or MaxisNite (MN) version. If you're unsure, choose the MN version.

    2.  Unzip the .zip and move its contents to Documents/SimCity 4/Plugins.

    3.  SC4Lot files are descriptively titled. Remove the lot versions which you don't want. Do not remove any .SC4Model files.
