  description:
    This mod replaces all of the maxis trees in-game, oaks, pines & palms. It makes your neighborhoods much more "full" as they should be in real life. And you no longer have to wait for
    saplings to grow over the years. A recommended mod is [SFBTs' street tree mod](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=1196) (used in the pictures) or similar.
