    This package contains props, textures and custom queries for use in upcoming SimCity Aviation Group (SCAG) releases.


    During the install process for the SCAG Mega Dependency One, you will be asked to choose a style of ground textures for the SCAG Turboprops lots. These texture sets work by having the same IIDs,
    so whichever of the sets you have in your plugins at a time, that style will apear on the lots. The three options are: North American, New Zealand and Australia/Europe.


    If you are unsure which set is best for you, please visit the [SCAG Turboprops Thread](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=8567.0) at SC4Devotion. Any questionsyou have regarding
    the textures can be answered there. **However it's a purely aesthetic change, and won't affect gameplay no matter which you choose.**


    For general support of SCAG releases, please post in SCAG Help, in the [SCAG Place](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?board=266.0) at SC4D.


    The dependency pack also contains other props and textures that do not override eachother. These will be needed for SCAG Aircraft lots. They include Aircraft containers (LD-3s), Baggage carts, and
    some airport vehicles. In Lot editor they can be found under the prefixes SCAG\-, JLY- and ADR-.


    Anyone can use these resources in their own lots, provided they do not reupload this package without the consent of the SCAG Team.
