    **WARNING!** This mod makes drastic changes to the way a city's power plants work. As such, you MUST have bulldozed ALL power plants and any other supported buildings from your cities before
    installation. Failure to do so can result in a corrupted save game. BACK UP YOUR REGION BEFORE INSTALL. It is recommended that after installing this mod you begin a fresh region with no cities in
    it. SUPPORT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET AMPS TO WORK IN AN EXISTING CITY!


    AMPS makes changes in the way that power buildings are constructed in SimCity 4, requiring the construction of a grid before power plants can be built. It is an extensive overhaul of the power
    system and takes getting use to, but once you've played it a few times I feel it's very intuitive. Part of the work this mod does is take the Maxis power plants and dozens of optional power plants
    available on the LEX and STEX and make them integrated into one seamless whole that is organized, user friendly, and well balanced. No power plant is really "better" than any of the others are,
    because each provides something the others don't. Integration also includes a set of custom icons for the Power Menu that has been completely reorganized to make finding the plant you're looking
    for easier and quicker, despite having close to a hundred options.


    TODO: Colyn's CSX Mini Generator - https://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=634 File no longer available on the new SC4E site


    All lots that are directly supported by AMPS may use the AMPS_Mini_Banner.png in the STEX listings to show compatibility with this mod if they wish.
