    **WARNING!** This mod makes drastic changes to the way a city's power plants work. As such, you MUST have bulldozed ALL power plants and any other supported buildings from your cities before
    installation. Failure to do so can result in a corrupted save game. BACK UP YOUR REGION BEFORE INSTALL. It is recommended that after installing this mod you begin a fresh region with no cities in
    it. SUPPORT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED IF YOU ARE TRYING TO GET AMPS TO WORK IN AN EXISTING CITY!


    AMPS makes changes in the way that power buildings are constructed in SimCity 4, requiring the construction of a grid before power plants can be built. It is an extensive overhaul of the power
    system and takes getting use to, but once you've played it a few times I feel it's very intuitive. Part of the work this mod does is take the Maxis power plants and dozens of optional power plants
    available on the LEX and STEX and make them integrated into one seamless whole that is organized, user friendly, and well balanced. No power plant is really "better" than any of the others are,
    because each provides something the others don't. Integration also includes a set of custom icons for the Power Menu that has been completely reorganized to make finding the plant you're looking
    for easier and quicker, despite having close to a hundred options.


    Dependencies:


    There are NO dependencies in the traditional sense. If you Install AMPS with nothing else, it will work... and you won't be able to build any of the supported power plants, which include all Maxis
    plants. I designed AMPS to be very dynamic and provide automatic integration of any supported lots you happen to have installed. Certain lots however are essentially mandatory in order to actually
    do anything. I've called these "hard requirements" and not "dependencies" so as to not cause confusion with such a well-established term. The Hard Requirements are as follows: (please note that
    most of these downloads do have Dependencies and they are required to use these lots with or without AMPS)


    Transformer Lots by Kloudkicker - Provides the backbone of the grid. Without them, you can't build much of anything power related.


    KK Transformer Lots-Small - https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/34273-kk-transformer-lots-small/


    Substation Lots by Simmer2 - There are many substations, but these three are non-optional as they form the core of early grid construction.


    SM2 HV Transformer - https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/32790-sm2-hv-transformer/


    SM2 Main Transformer & Main Transformer with building - https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/31369-sm2-main-transformers/


    Transmission Station by Takingyouthere - The required station to unlock most of the Maxis power plants.


    Transformer lot - https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/31217-transformer-substation/


    All other downloads are OPTIONAL. Certain ones expand your options and are referred to as "Soft Requirements." These are as follows:


    Needed to build Wind Turbines (such as the Maxis Wind Power Plant)


    KK Wind Farm Maintenance Facility - https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/34196-kk-wind-farm-maintenance-facility/


    Needed to have power while you build a grid (these are essentially the only power plants available on Day 1 of a new city)


    kaos78414's Generator - https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/19458-kaos-rusty-generator/


    Colyn's CSX Mini Generator - https://sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=634 File no longer available on the new SC4E site


    Simmer2's SM2 Mobile Power Generator - https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/31431-sm2-mobile-power-generator/


    All lots that are directly supported by AMPS may use the AMPS_Mini_Banner.png in the STEX listings to show compatibility with this mod if they wish.
