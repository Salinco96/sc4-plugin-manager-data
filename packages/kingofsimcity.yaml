    Do you want to recreate a large distribution center with ample truck parking space of all angles and populate them with tons of random trailers from different freight and logistic companies? If
    so, then you've come to the right place!


    **Package Overview**


    This package contains a set of 175 overlay textures, offered in either white or yellow (mostly) paint. There are **36** prop families for
    [@MushyMushy](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/532257-mushymushy/)'s HD North American trucks and cabs, covering all bases and angles.


    Update 2.0 introduces **16 new prop families** that cover some of the more irregular angles of [@Angry Mozart](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/430892-angry-mozart/)'s cabs. Additional
    details are in the enclosed README.


    Credit goes to **MushyMushy** and **Angry Mozart** for the wonderful set of trailers and semis!

    This is the **1st addon pack** of my **SuperParking** modular parking series. Unlike a full-blown expansion, this small pack covers some odds and ends that I missed on the original sets. These
    include full no road marking support for all junction variations, and a couple of transitions for a few awkward spots.


    The set contains a set of **14** lots**,** all of which are cosmetic pieces located near the top of the **Parks** menu. Like before all of the menus are grouped and color coded according to the
    specific type of parking. DAMN menu support for this addon pack is included in the **integrated package [here.](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30955-kosc-sp-damn-menus/)**


    **General Stats**


    ***Cosmetic Pieces***


    *Plop Cost: $0 - $9\*


    \*The minor plop cost introduced here was to allow for cleaner organization of menu items, so that like groups are kept together.*


    All of the cosmetic pieces are considered “neutral lots”, meaning they have pretty much no stats, come at *no* maintenance cost, and are not of any particular wealth. The detailing on these lots
    were kept minimal, as to ensure that MMPs can be used on them liberally.


    Last but not least, credit to **RebaLynnTS** for the helper pieces, and **shokthrpy** for his awesome parking set.

    It's been a long time coming, but it's finally here! This is the **1<sup>st</sup>** part of my **SuperParking** modular parking series, which is aimed towards creating even more realistic and
    crazy parking derivatives from the original **SHK Parking Pack**. This is the base set, which contains all the essentials for making orthogonal oriented parking lots, junctions, and more.


    The set contains a set of **49** lots. There are **7** functional “parking garage” pieces, with Transit Enabled connections which are located in the **Misc Transportation** menu, and **42**
    cosmetic pieces located near the top of the **Parks** menu. All of the menus are grouped and color coded according to the specific type of parking, ranging from **A** to **D** type. These are
    broken down in the included readme. For those that prefer less cluttered menus, there's [**DAMN Support**](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30955-kosc-sp-damn-menus/) for these.

    This is the **1st expansion pack** of my **SuperParking** modular parking series, which is aimed towards creating even more realistic and crazy parking derivatives from the original **SHK Parking
    Pack**. This set covers **diagonals** - largely uncharted territory - by adding a plethora of new parking options for your cities including the ability to create fully-diagonal oriented parking
    lots. As if that wasn't enough, there's a wealth of different orthogonal transitions and connector pieces to combine with the base set for even more ridiculous combinations.


    The set contains a set of **50** lots. There are **3** functional “parking garage” pieces, with Transit Enabled connections which are located in the **Misc Transportation** menu, and **47**
    cosmetic pieces located near the top of the **Parks** menu. All of the menus are grouped and color coded according to the specific type of parking, including **A, B,** and **Joiner** categories.
    For users that prefer less clutter, there's **[DAMN Support](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30955-kosc-sp-damn-menus/)** for these!


    **General Stats**


    ***Entrances***


    *Plop Cost: $250


    Capacity: 1,000*


    ***Cosmetic Pieces***


    *Plop Cost: $0 - $6\*

    were kept minimal, as to ensure that MMPs can be used on them liberally.


    Once again, some credit needs to go to **[@rsc204](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/651629-rsc204/)** for providing me with his blended width transition stubs.


    Last but not least, credit to **RebaLynnTS** for the helper pieces, and **shokthrpy** for his awesome parking set.

    Happy New Year! Need some irregularity in your lotting? **SuperSHK** is back with a plus and a whole assortment of FA3-aligned textures for you to play with.


    **Overview**


    This set contains at total of **482** new overlay textures.


    SuperSHK+ takes the original set and adds quite a bit of additional support for FA3 angled pathways. Additionally, there are a host of extra textures included meant to patch some missing areas
    from the first set.


    **Details**


    These textures are broken into **4** DATs. The included resource guide offers a slightly more detailed look at the different texture options offered here.


    **DAT 1 - Curbs:** Contains an assortment of FA3 aligned curb pieces and connectors.


    **DAT 2 - Parking Transitions:** Contains transitions and intersections between different parking types with FA3 curbs.


    **DAT 3 - Pseudo-FA3 (PFA3):** Contains a set of FA3 aligned orthogonal parking spaces and a few basic transitions.


    **DAT 4 - Extras:** Adds medians and additional support for S-Curves from the original set.


    Credit to **shokthrpy** for the original SHK set. Additional thanks goes out to **rsc204 & rivit** for their invaluable work with GoFSH (and Bender) and texture replacement - this set would not be
    possible without their tools.

      description: >-
        King of SimCity [recently published a repository of its SuperSHK and SuperSHK+
        textures](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/66287-koscs-relot-parking-mania/?do=findComment&comment=1649616) and taking the opportunity to expand the coverage of my sidewalk mod,
        I've downloaded it and created this custom textures, that REPLACE KOSC's ones. **Why replace?** Because it allows you to use them directly on any lot that already uses SuperSHK parkings, and
        because I'm lazy enough to not even try to get my own IID range.


        As a design choice, these textures **don't include the coloured tiles on the paving** (because keeping them produced some strange cropped and jagged patterns), but only the base tiles,
        subtlely wealthified like in the sidewalk mod.


        This is the **Sudden Valley version of the retexture**, but it uses an open source texture that merely matches the colour and grain of Gobias' mod, so there is no actual redistributing of his
        work. In the near future and according to the users' demand, I'll release more versions for SD and HD grass textures; same thing if I manage to publish the basalt tiles' sidewalk.


        **COMPATIBILITY:**


        This mod REPLACES the original SuperSHK and SuperSHK+ (FAR) textures, so get sure it will load AFTER THE ORIGINAL KOSC FILES; alternatively, you can overwrite them to use less disk space, but
        that's not necessary. As they are a replacement pack, the textures will be automatically changed on all lots that use the original textures.


        **AKNOWLEGDEMENTS:**


        This mod would have fundamentally impossible to do without the work of Rivit, MGB, Gobias and KOSC.


        I'm basically blending their creations or mimicking them, and using their software to create usable plugins.


        As is obvious, this mod will work but look awkward without using both [**Gobias' Sudden Valley** terrain mod](https://www.sc4devotion.com/csxlex/lex_filedesc.php?lotGET=2867) and my [**Veredas
        Santiaguinas** sidewalk mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/31166-veredas-santiaguinas-sidewalk-mod/). You can also achieve a more seamless look complementing with [**MGB's TGN**
        for Sudden Valley](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30162-mgb-terrain-grass-nam-tgn-for-gobias-sudden-valley/). Even more obvious, as this is a replacement pack for a dependency,
        you'll see nothing of it working unless you have grown or plopped lots that use the textures: look for lots that require the **SuperSHK** textures or use [**KOSC Superparking** modular
        lots](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30941-kosc-sp-modular-parking-base-set/) to create your own parking lots in game.


        **LICENSE:**


        This mod has a **Creative Commons Attribution - Non Commercial 4.0 International** license, what means you can use all its content directly or creating something derivatively, as long as you
        give explicit attribution to all previous authors, and as long as you don't charge for accessing or using this content or a derivative you create of it.


        To create the textures, I used a grass texture on the public domain and Paint.NET to mimic the colour of Gobias' Sudden Valley; and obviously, KOSC's SuperSHK repository. This last one is
        subject to its own license (check the linked post above) and previous authors, particularly **Shokthrpy**.
