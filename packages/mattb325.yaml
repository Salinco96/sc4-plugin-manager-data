    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the standard Commercial BATs by legendary BSC BATer Mattb325, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion. It includes the
    contents of 73 previously separate downloads. After battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in
    June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to
    install.


    There are two versions of this package that exist as separate downloads. One (MN) is for Maxis Nite (the default night settings), while the other (DN) is for Dark Nite, and is optimized for use
    with darker Night Mods, such as the mods by SimFox and gizmo28.


    Some of the Lots in here come with additional Ploppable options, or are Ploppable Only. Ploppable Only Lots are noted as "(Ploppable)" in the installer, and those with options will have the
    Ploppable option deselectable at a sublevel (click "+" to expand and deselect the Ploppable verison if you do not wish to install it).


    Updated to Version 2 (17 August 2023): Added Nokia Building CO and City College CS.


    Please note that this pack **_may_** receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and
    provide technical support for the pack.


    #### Installation


    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.


    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\--or a zip tool capable
    of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org), and for macOS, use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).


    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which files you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything). To expand
    options, click the small "+" next to the name of the section.


    Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). On the Cleanup tab, click "Start scan" to find any
    outdated files that currently reside in your Plugins folder that may conflict with this package. Clicking "Backup" will remove these old files to a safe location. (The option to "Delete" them also
    exists, but is not recommended.) After this, click over to the Install tab, and click "Start installation" to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a
    message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.

    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)

    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the Multi-Unit Residentials by legendary BSC BATer Mattb325, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion. It includes the contents
    of 46 previously separate downloads. After battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June
    2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    There are two versions of this package that exist as separate downloads. One (MN) is for Maxis Nite (the default night settings), while the other (DN) is for Dark Nite, and is optimized for use
    with darker Night Mods, such as the mods by SimFox and gizmo28.


    Please note that this pack **_may_** receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and
    provide technical support for the pack.


    **Revision 2 (14 August 2023): Moved Lansdown Terrace Model to improve support for Lansdown Terrace Commercial in Commercial W2W Pack.**


    ####  Installation


    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.


    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\--or a zip tool capable
    of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org), and for macOS, use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).


    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything). To
    expand options, click the small "+" next to the name of the section.


    Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). On the Cleanup tab, click "Start scan" to find any
    outdated files that currently reside in your Plugins folder that may conflict with this package. Clicking "Backup" will remove these old files to a safe location. (The option to "Delete" them also
    exists, but is not recommended.) After this, click over to the Install tab, and click "Start installation" to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a
    message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.


    **NOTE about the Casa de Manana**: The Casa de Manana building has two options, only one of which can be installed at one time. One is for use in Subtropical environments (think palm trees) and
    one for Temperate environments. You can select which one you want in the installer.


    ####  Dependencies


    The following files are required in order for the contents of this package to appear correctly (i.e., no "brown boxes" or missing textures):

    ##### Special Thanks


    Webmaster & administration staff at SC4Evermore and SC4 Devotion.


    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)

    Various pieces of original documentation can be found in the "~Documents" folder, which, while installed in the Plugins directory, should be removed.


    **rev1 update (11 Aug 2023)** - moved Original Documents into .zip file to avoid issues with the Java installer reading them instead of installing them, and redesigned behavior of folder
    installation process to have subfolders, instead of all files loose in the Residential Multi-Unit folder.  If you're already using Version 1, this update is strictly for housekeeping, and not
    critical.  No changes to the actual SC4 content have been made.

    These are a series (16 models) of 19th century looking commercial shops that you typically find in the historical center of old towns and cities. The models were made by **Mattb325** the lotting
    and modding was made by **SimCoug**. 


    > I mentioned to mattb325 about an idea I had for some 19th century looking commercial shops that you typically find in the historical center of old towns and cities. He was gracious enough to
    whip up some amazing models, so I was left to try and make some lots that would show these beauties.

    > Mattb made a huge number of variations (16 total models) so I modded them into prop families.

    > There are 9 growable CS$$ lots, sized 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2.  The stats are in line with similar maxis buildings.

    > The US looking buildings will grow on the Chicago and NY tilesets, while the UK looking models will grow on the European tileset.

    > I've also included two ploppable landmark lots with CS$$ jobs.

    ### Installation**:**


    Installation**:** Copy/Extract the **BSC** parent folder into your Plugins. If you extracted the _~Documents_ folder into you plugins too, it's highly recommended to keep it, but move it out of
    the Plugins folder.


    Feel free to delete the growable or ploppable lots, depending on your needs.    The MattB325\_HistoricShops\_Resource.dat is necessary though - don't remove that. In the _BSCProps_ folder you will
    find a **Mattb325\_Old\_Shops\_DN.dat** and a **Mattb325\_Old\_Shops\_MN.dat**.


    Choose one of them depending on if you are using Dark Night/True Night (DN) mod or not.


    ### Dependencies:


    Just the mattb325 models – **INCLUDED**


    If you use the dark nite version, you will need a dark nite mod. Either:
    ([http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/](http://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/23089-simfox-day-and-nite-modd/)) OR
    ([http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php](http://gizmo.aplaceforwebsite.com/index.php))


    ### Developer notes:


    I created these lots to fit in any city or town - everything is lotted using maxis so as to limit the dependencies.  Please feel free to change textures/props as you wish.  Think of this as the
    bare bones version.     


    ### Support:


    For questions regarding this set, please feel free to visit my Lot Development Thread ([**SimCoug's Lot Den**](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68540-simcougs-lotmod-den/)).


    ### Special Thanks:


    mattb325 of course!  Go over to his [BAT thread](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=327.0) and give him a huge thanks

    This is the Dark Nite version of the Mattb325 Urban Civics Prop Pack Vol01, containing props created and used by legendary BSC BATer Mattb325.


    This version is intended for use with the default Maxis night settings.  If you are using a darker night mod, such as the ones by gizmo28 or SimFox, there is a separate [Dark Nite
    version](/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/96-mattb325-urban-civics-prop-pack-vol01-darknite) that you should use instead.
