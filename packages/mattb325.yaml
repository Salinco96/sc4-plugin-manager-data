    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the standard Commercial BATs by legendary BSC BATer Mattb325, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion. It includes the
    contents of 73 previously separate downloads. After battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in
    June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to
    install.


    There are two versions of this package that exist as separate downloads. One (MN) is for Maxis Nite (the default night settings), while the other (DN) is for Dark Nite, and is optimized for use
    with darker Night Mods, such as the mods by SimFox and gizmo28.


    Some of the Lots in here come with additional Ploppable options, or are Ploppable Only. Ploppable Only Lots are noted as "(Ploppable)" in the installer, and those with options will have the
    Ploppable option deselectable at a sublevel (click "+" to expand and deselect the Ploppable verison if you do not wish to install it).


    Updated to Version 2 (17 August 2023): Added Nokia Building CO and City College CS.


    Please note that this pack ***may*** receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and
    provide technical support for the pack.


    #### Credits


    The following BSC members contributed models, textures, and modding support to this collection:


    - Mattb325


    This package was assembled by Tarkus.


    ##### Special Thanks


    Webmaster & administration staff at SC4Evermore and SC4 Devotion.


    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)

    At the request of a fellow SC4 player, these luxurious terraces fronting London's Holland Park are now available for SC4.


    This wealthy part of London is famous for its glistening white, wide-fronted and commodious homes. These terraces are a far cry from the slums of the east end, or indeed the nearby mews which once
    housed servants and stables. Given the multi million pound price tags, most of these terraces are now embassies and consulates.


    This terrace provides a home for 23 R$$$ sims and is offered as a 1x1 and 1x2 lot for medium and high density zoning.


    **STATS:**


    Bulldoze Cost: $303


    Capacity satisfied: R$$$ 23 (R$$ 49, R$ 86 when dilapidated)


    Pollution at center: 1/1/4


    Radius: 6/7/0


    Water consumed: 7 Gallons


    Power Consumed: 3 MwH


    Thank you and enjoy

    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the Multi-Unit Residentials by legendary BSC BATer Mattb325, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion. It includes the contents
    of 46 previously separate downloads. After battling a number of technical issues, software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June
    2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    There are two versions of this package that exist as separate downloads. One (MN) is for Maxis Nite (the default night settings), while the other (DN) is for Dark Nite, and is optimized for use
    with darker Night Mods, such as the mods by SimFox and gizmo28.


    Please note that this pack ***may*** receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain, update, and
    provide technical support for the pack.


    #### Credits


    The following BSC members contributed models, textures, and modding support to this collection:


    - Mattb325


    This package was assembled by Tarkus.


    ##### Special Thanks


    Webmaster & administration staff at SC4Evermore and SC4 Devotion.


    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)

    These are a series (16 models) of 19th century looking commercial shops that you typically find in the historical center of old towns and cities. The models were made by **Mattb325** the lotting
    and modding was made by **SimCoug**.


    > I mentioned to mattb325 about an idea I had for some 19th century looking commercial shops that you typically find in the historical center of old towns and cities. He was gracious enough to
    whip up some amazing models, so I was left to try and make some lots that would show these beauties.

    >

    > Mattb made a huge number of variations (16 total models) so I modded them into prop families.

    >

    > There are 9 growable CS$$ lots, sized 1x1, 1x2 and 2x2. The stats are in line with similar maxis buildings.

    >

    > The US looking buildings will grow on the Chicago and NY tilesets, while the UK looking models will grow on the European tileset.

    >

    > I've also included two ploppable landmark lots with CS$$ jobs.

    >

    ### Developer notes:


    I created these lots to fit in any city or town - everything is lotted using maxis so as to limit the dependencies. Please feel free to change textures/props as you wish. Think of this as the bare
    bones version.


    ### Support:


    For questions regarding this set, please feel free to visit my Lot Development Thread ([**SimCoug's Lot Den**](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68540-simcougs-lotmod-den/)).


    ### Special Thanks:


    mattb325 of course! Go over to his [BAT thread](https://www.sc4devotion.com/forums/index.php?topic=327.0) and give him a huge thanks

    This is the Dark Nite version of the Mattb325 Urban Civics Prop Pack Vol01, containing props created and used by legendary BSC BATer Mattb325.


    This version is intended for use with the default Maxis night settings. If you are using a darker night mod, such as the ones by gizmo28 or SimFox, there is a separate [Dark Nite
    version](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/96-mattb325-urban-civics-prop-pack-vol01-darknite) that you should use instead.
