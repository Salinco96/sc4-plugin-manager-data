    I've been wanting to add more slope-friendly buildings to my cities for a long time. This NYC-inspired apartment building has a custom foundation, and the stairs and ramps will show on mildly
    sloped terrain. It is a medium density residential lot and only grows on the New York tileset.


    Lot Size: 3x2


    Growth Stage: 6


    Capacity: 255 R$$


    Building Style: New York


    Power Consumed: 4


    Water Consumed: 36

    This is a set of four buildings for fractionally angled networks. Included is an FA2 building overhanging a 2x2 lot, an FA3 building overhanging a 3x2 lot, and a mirrored version of each.

    They are inspired by mid-rise New York apartment buildings, but are ploppable, rather than residential, so that they can be placed along FA roads.

    Each building costs $100 to plop, and functions as a landmark.

    Contains a set of five 1x2 low-density (stage 3 for the corner lots, stage 2 for the others), medium-wealth growable commercial lots. Also includes a ploppable 5x2 landmark with all five
    buildings.


    They are inspired by wall-to-wall businesses in Brooklyn, and will grow on NY tileset only.
