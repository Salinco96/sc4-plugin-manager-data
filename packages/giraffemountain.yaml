    I've been wanting to add more slope-friendly buildings to my cities for a long time. This NYC-inspired apartment building has a custom foundation, and the stairs and ramps will show on mildly
    sloped terrain. It is a medium density residential lot and only grows on the New York tileset.


    Lot Size: 3x2


    Growth Stage: 6


    Capacity: 255 R$$


    Building Style: New York


    Power Consumed: 4


    Water Consumed: 36

    This is a set of four buildings for fractionally angled networks. Included is an FA2 building overhanging a 2x2 lot, an FA3 building overhanging a 3x2 lot, and a mirrored version of each.

    They are inspired by mid-rise New York apartment buildings, but are ploppable, rather than residential, so that they can be placed along FA roads.

    Each building costs $100 to plop, and functions as a landmark.

        FA2 and FA3 Growify lots for giraffemountain models


        By Kel9505


        Based off of giraffemountain's FA2 and FA3 models


        Included are two FA2 and two FA3 lots based off of giraffemountain's original lots and models. They have been transformed into ploppable R$ Residential lots that can be used in the game if
        Growifed with the growify DLL mod by Null45.


        These are LOTS ONLY, and do not include the models. These are new lots and do not overwrite giraffemountain's original landmark eyecandy lots.


        Note: This mod requires DLL dependencies by Null45. DLL Dependencies are ONLY available for version 1.1.641 of SimCity 4 (Windows Digital Copies). All dependencies listed below are REQUIRED
        for these lots to work.


        REQUIRED DEPENDENCIES:


        1\. [FA2 and FA3 Mid-rises](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36329-fa2-and-fa3-mid-rises/), by giraffemountain


        2\. [Growify DLL Mod](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36180-growify-plopped-buildings-cheat-dll-plugin/), by Null45


        TO INSTALL:


        Make sure Simcity4 is not running prior to installation.


        Extract all files into your Simcity4 Plugins folder. The archive can be extracted into a subfolder containing giraffemountain's models and original lots, and will create a subfolder with the
        growify lots.


        TO USE:


        Pause the game, plop the lots along a FA2 or FA3 street, as needed, use the Growify cheat code "Growify R M" or "Growify R H" to growify the lots as medium density or high density lots. Make
        sure they have water and power or, like any other lot, they may abandon. If you have the submenu DLL mod by memo, the lots will appear in the Residential Zone menu under R$ Ploppables.


        STATS:


        FA2: R$ 382 sims


        FA2 mirror: R$ 396 sims


        FA3: R$ 810 sims


        FA3 mirror: R$ 804 sims
