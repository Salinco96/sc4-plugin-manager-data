    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the BSC Team and SC4D LEX Restoration Team-assembled prop packs of popular Japanese BATer SOMY, which had been available on the Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4
    Devotion. This compilation also contains most (if not all) of the models that SOMY ever released on their websites over the years. After battling a number of technical issues, software
    incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use form,
    allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    #### CHANGE LOG


    - 20.01.2024 - Update to Version 2


    - Official update in the installer itself


    - Some small adjustments and clean-ups in the prop packs and within the upload


    #### Installation


    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.


    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\--or a zip tool capable
    of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org), and for macOS, use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).


    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything).
    Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). On the Cleanup tab, click "Start scan" to find any
    outdated files that currently reside in your Plugins folder that may conflict with this package. Clicking "Backup" will remove these old files to a safe location. (The option to "Delete" them also
    exists, but is not recommended.)\*\* After this, click over to the Install tab, and click "Start installation" to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a
    message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.


    \*\* Though there is an inbuilt cleanitol function in the installer, at this point it is not working entirely properly so it is highly recommended to run the individual cleanitol files or the
    master cleanitol for the compilation with one of the following 3rd party cleanitol tools:


    [nos.17 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/) (new tool)


    [BSC Cleanitol](https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/18-bsc-cleanitol) (old tool)


    #### Credits


    The following members contributed models to this collection:


    - SOMY

        Bear in mind that most of the models with the original lots created by SOMY are still available on their website:

        https://somy.gozaru.jp/p1.htm

    This package has been made possible by the Project ZIP efforts of Tyberius06, and was assembled by Tarkus. Previous Prop Pack assembly performed by members of the BSC.


    ##### Special Thanks


    Webmaster & administration staff at SC4 Devotion and SC4Evermore.


    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)

    A set of 10 houses by **SOMY** that have been updated using the X_Tool and also have had the dummy building replaced by a building model. The capacity now varies according to the number and size
    of houses on the lot. All except one are stage 3 R$$ and the lotting is unchanged from the originals.


    **If you have the originals please bulldoze any in your cities before installing these as the IIDs are also unchanged and although the city should not crash you may have problems.**


    ### Lot Details and Information


    **Growable Version:**


    |     |     |

    | --- | --- |

    | Lot size: | 1 x 4 tiles |

    | Building style(s): | Building: Residential,Building: R$$,Style: Chicago,Style: New York,Style: Houston,Style: Euro |

    | Growth stage: | 3   |

    | Occupants: | R-$ : 44 to 94,R-$$ : 26 to 53 |

    | Bulldoze cost: | § 215 |

    | Worth: | § 678 |

    | Construction Time: | 21 days |

    | Air pollution: | 1 over 5 tiles |

    | Water pollution: | 1 over 6 tiles |

    | Garbage pollution: | 4 over 0 tiles |


    **Installation:** Copy/Extract the **SOMY** parent folder into your Plugins. If you extracted the *~Documents* folder into your plugins, too, it's highly recommended to keep it, but move it out of
    the Plugins folder.


    **Un-Installing:** To un-install the files, simply bulldoze every lot from this download in your cities and delete the files from the plugins folder afterwards.


    It is highly recommended to run the provided *Cleanitol_SOMY_jpn_houses.txt* cleanitol file for the compilation with one of the following 3rd party cleanitol tools, which can help you remove the
    old packs or you can remove them manually:


    [nos.17 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/) (new tool)


    [BSC Cleanitol](https://sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/18-bsc-cleanitol) (old tool).
