    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the BSC Team and SC4D LEX Restoration Team-assembled prop and texture dependencies produced by the Japanese BATer NOB, which had been available on the
    Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion, most of which were produced between 2007 and 2009, many being compilations of earlier BSC packs themselves. After battling a number of technical issues,
    software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use
    form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    **CHANGE LOG**


    *   01.01.2024 20.01.2024 - Update to Version 2


    *   Official update in the installer itself


    *   The NOB Texture Pack Vol01 has been updated to Version 2 (v2) - there was an underlying conflict with other textures created by other content creators almost 2 decades ago. This has been
    fixed.


    ####  Installation


    This package utilizes a Java-based installer (similar to the one used with the Network Addon Mod), and can also be opened and installed manually using 7-Zip or Keka.


    To install it, you'll either need the Java Runtime Environment to run the installer--[Adoptium's open-source edition is recommended](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases)\--or a zip tool capable
    of opening the installer to allow manual installation. For Windows/Linux, use [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org), and for macOS, use [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/).

    Once into the installer, after agreeing to the terms for the package, click to the Files tab to select which dependencies you wish to install (making no changes here will install everything).
    Then, click to the Location tab to set up an installation location (this should be the root of your My DocumentsSimCity 4Plugins folder). On the Cleanup tab, click "Start scan" to find any
    outdated files that currently reside in your Plugins folder that may conflict with this package. Clicking "Backup" will remove these old files to a safe location. (The option to "Delete" them also
    exists, but is not recommended.)\*\* After this, click over to the Install tab, and click "Start installation" to begin the installation procedure. When installation is complete, the tab pop up a
    message indicating it, after which you are safe to close the installer.


    \*\* Though there is an inbuilt cleanitol function in the installer, at this point it is not working entirely properly so it is highly recommended to run the individual cleanitol files or the
    master cleanitol for the compilation with one of the following 3rd party cleanitol tools:


    [nos.17 Cleanitol](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/35790-sc4-cleanitol/) (new tool released a month ago)


    [BSC Cleanitol](/index.php/downloads/download/30-gameplay-utilities/18-bsc-cleanitol) (old, but stable tool)


    ####  Credits


    The following members contributed models, textures, and modding support to this collection:


    *   NOB
        Bear in mind that most of the models with the original lots created by NOB are still available on the hidden parts of the Hide-inoki (HaS) site as archives:
        [http://hide-inoki.com/~nob/index.html](http://hide-inoki.com/%7Enob/index.html)

    This package has been made possible by the Project ZIP efforts of Tyberius06, and was assembled by Tarkus. Original repackaging into Mega Packs done by members of the BSC (BarbyW, RippleJet).


    ##### Special Thanks


    Webmaster & administration staff at SC4 Devotion.


    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)
