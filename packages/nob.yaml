    This SC4 Devotion LEX Legacy Pack features the BSC Team and SC4D LEX Restoration Team-assembled prop and texture dependencies produced by the Japanese BATer NOB, which had been available on the
    Lot Exchange (LEX) at SC4 Devotion, most of which were produced between 2007 and 2009, many being compilations of earlier BSC packs themselves. After battling a number of technical issues,
    software incompatibility ultimately shuttered the LEX (at least in its familiar form from 2007 onward) in June 2023, and this package is designed to collect these dependencies in an easy-to-use
    form, allowing users to install them all in one go, or carefully select exactly which packs they wish to install.


    Please note that this pack **is** expected to receive updates in the near future. Do not redistribute without asking first, mostly as doing so would complicate efforts to properly maintain,
    update, and provide technical support for the pack.


    #### Credits


    The following members contributed models, textures, and modding support to this collection:


    - NOB

        Bear in mind that most of the models with the original lots created by NOB are still available on the hidden parts of the Hide-inoki (HaS) site as archives:

        [http://hide-inoki.com/~nob/index.html](http://hide-inoki.com/%7Enob/index.html)

    This package has been made possible by the Project ZIP efforts of Tyberius06, and was assembled by Tarkus. Original repackaging into Mega Packs done by members of the BSC (BarbyW, RippleJet).


    ##### Special Thanks


    Webmaster & administration staff at SC4 Devotion.


    And possibly others who may not have been mentioned. If your name has been forgotten or you're not on the list, then drop us a line, as it has been difficult to keep track of anyone/everyone that
    may of helped somewhere along the lines.


    And to the community itself, we would also like to thank you for your support, making mods such as this possible too. We're still at it after **20 years** thanks to you!


    And last but not least, a thanks for the Maxis individuals too, for the \[paid\] work that they did. ;-)
