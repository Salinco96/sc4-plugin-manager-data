null-45/growify-plops-dll:
  authors:
    - Null 45
  category: cheats,dll
  description: >-
    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that adds a cheat code to convert plopped buildings to a growable RCI zone type.


    This mod is an in-game equivalent to the [SC4](https://github.com/sebamarynissen/sc4) command line tool's *growify* command for editing save games (and the [website
    version](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/760843-growifiercom-ploppable-residentials/)).


    One of the differences between the two tools is the building exemplar property that is used to detect the RCI building type.


    The SC4 command line tool uses the *Capacity Satisfied* property from the savegame's lot subfile.


    This plugin uses the *Purpose* property from the building's exemplar.


    **System Requirements**


    - SimCity 4 version 641

    - Windows 10 or later


    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) installed, but I do not have the ability to test
    that.


    **Using The Plugin**


    The plugin adds a *Growify* cheat code with the following syntax:


    *Growify &lt;zone type&gt; &lt;zone density&gt; \[make historical\]*


    The **&lt;zone type&gt;** parameter is one of: Residential, Commercial, Agriculture or Industrial.


    The **&lt;zone density&gt;** parameter is one of: Low, Medium or High.


    The **\[make historical\]** parameter is optional, when not present it will default to *true*. This behavior is intended to prevent the game from replacing the plopped building as part of its
    normal zone redevelopment process. Setting the value to *false* will preserve the game's existing historical option for that lot.


    All commands are case-insensitive.


    **Example Commands**


    The following command converts all commercial plopped buildings to the Commercial Medium-density zone: *Growify Commercial Medium* To save typing, you could also use: *Growify Com Med* or *Growify
    C M*. This works with any zone or density value.


    Because the Agriculture zone only has 1 density, it can be used with just the zone name: *Growify Agriculture*.


    **Troubleshooting**


    The plugin should write a *SC4Growify.log* file in the same folder as the plugin.


    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.


    **Source Code and Support**

null-45/more-building-styles-dll:
  authors:
    - Null 45
  category: dependencies,dll
  description: >-
    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that allows the game to use more than 4 building styles.


    This DLL mod is intended as a dependency for other mods that add new building styles beyond the 4 that Maxis included, it does not add any building styles to the game by itself.


    Maxis programmed the Building Style Control UI to only recognize the check boxes of the 4 built-in styles, no matter how may check boxes are actually present. This mod patches the game's memory to
    remove that restriction.


    **Adding More Building Styles into SC4**


    This is a brief overview of the process required to add new building styles into the game.


    1.  Create a patch that overrides the default Building Style Control UI, TGI 0x00000000,0x96a006b0,0x6bc61f19 in *SimCity_1.dat*.

    2.  Edit the building style UI in the patch to add a check box for your new style(s).
        - The check box ID (e.g. 0x2003) identifies the building style to the game, these IDs should be in the range of 0x2000 to 0x2fff.
    3.  Update the building OG values to use the new style.


    [@CorinaMarie](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/737259-corinamarie/) has a
    [post](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/758810-partial-mythbusting-building-style-tilesets-not-locked-down-in-the-exe/?do=findComment&comment=1765958) with more details on how to
    update a building to a new style. Note that you only need to follow the steps in that post up to step 8. The additional steps in that post are not required with this mod. It is not necessary to
    edit the Building Development Simulator when using the edited Building Style Control UI.


    **Auto-Historical Check Box**


    The DLL supports an optional check box that will automatically mark new growable residential and commercial lots as historical when SC4 creates them.


    This check box uses the reserved id value: *0x9476D8DA*


    **Cheat Codes**


    The DLL provides the following cheat codes:


    *ActiveStyle* shows an in-game message box with the ID of the currently active style when *Change building style every N years* is selected. When *Build all styles at once* is selected, using this
    cheat will display a message saying that mode is active.


    *DebugActiveStyles* writes the IDs of all the active/checked styles to the plugin's log file.


    **System Requirements**


    - SimCity 4 version 641

    - Windows 10 or later


    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) installed, but I do not have the ability to test
    that.


    **Troubleshooting**


    The plugin should write a *SC4MoreBuildingStyles.log* file in the same folder as the plugin.


    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.

    **System Requirements**


    - Windows 10 or later


    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) installed, but I do not have the ability to test
    that.


    **Troubleshooting**


    The plugin should write a *SC4MoreDemandInfo.log* file in the same folder as the plugin.


    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.

    This DLL plugin adds over two dozen new values for use in the building query UI and a network query advanced/debug tool tip.


    For DLL developers, it also provides services that can be used to add more building query values and/or customize the building and network tool tips.


    **New Building Query Variables**


    The DLL provides a number of new variables that can be used in the LTEXT files of a building query dialog in the form of #variable_name#.


    | Name | Description |

    | --- | --- |

    | building_full_funding_capacity | The cost for Education, Fire, Health, Police and Power buildings at the full (100%) capacity. For Fire and Police stations this is the coverage radius. |

    | building_full_funding_coverage | The cost for Education, and Health buildings at the full (100%) coverage radius (School Bus/Ambulance). |

    | building_styles | Shows a list of the building's styles. |

    | growth_stage | The growth stage of the building's lot. |

    | mysim_name | The name of the MySim that lives in the selected residence. |

null-45/sc4-auto-run-cheats-dll-plugin:
  authors:
    - Null 45
  category: cheats,dll
  description: >-
    A DLL Plugin for SimCity 4 that automatically executes cheat codes when loading the game or a city.


    **System Requirements**


    - Windows 10 or later


    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) installed, but I do not have the ability to test
    that.


    **Installation**


    1.  Close SimCity 4.

    2.  Copy *SC4AutoRunCheats.dll* and *SC4AutoRunCheats.ini* into the Plugins folder in the SimCity 4 installation directory.

    3.  Configure the plugin settings, see the Configuring the plugin section.


    **Configuring the plugin**


    1.  Open *SC4AutoRunCheats.ini* in a text editor (e.g. Notepad). Note that depending on the permissions of your SimCity 4 installation directory you may need to start the text editor with
    administrator permissions to be able to save the file.

    2.  Adjust the settings in the *\[Startup\]*, *\[Tile\]*, *\[EstablishedTile\]* and *\[UnestablishedTile\]* sections to your preferences.

    3.  Save the file and start the game.


    **Settings overview**


    The commands or cheat codes will be applied at the specified stages in the game's loading process. The RunOnce versions will only be applied for the first matching city tile that is loaded.


    The command strings can use one of two formats:


    - A comma-separated list of commands/cheats.

    - A File:&lt;path&gt; string that specifies an external file containing the commands/cheats.


    \[Startup\]: The commands in this section will be run once when the game starts up.


    \[Tile\]: The commands in this section will be run when loading either an established or unestablished city tile.


    \[EstablishedTile\]: The commands in this section will be run when loading an established city tile or when a city is established.


    \[UnestablishedTile\]: The commands in this section will be run when loading an unestablished city tile.


    **External File Format**


    The external file must place each command or cheat on its own line. The cheats/commands will be executed sequentially starting from the top of the file.


    **Troubleshooting**


    The plugin should write a SC4AutoRunCheats.log file in the same folder as the plugin.


    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.

  description: >-
    Optimizes the DBPF plugin loading that the game performs on startup.


    The effect that the plugin has on the game's startup time will depend on your system and plugins. It may have little to no effect for some configurations.


    **Features**


    - Reduces the time for the game to show the SC4 logo by up to 90%.

    - Adds an optimization to the game code for large data reads.

    - Disables the game code that searches the entire file if the DBPF signature was not found.

    - Changes the game code that loads the .SC4\* files to ignore files with non-DBPF file extensions, .txt, .png, etc.
        - With this change only .SC4Desc, .SC4Lot, .SC4Model, and files without any file extension will be loaded.
        - Files without any file extension are included due to some older plugins having that issue.
    - Changes the 'missing plugin' dialog to display the plugin pack ID in hexadecimal.


    **System Requirements**


    - SimCity 4 version 641

    - Windows 10 or later


    The plugin may work on Windows 7 or later with the [Microsoft Visual C++ 2022 x86 Redistribute](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) installed, but I do not have the ability to test
    that.


    **Command Line Argument**


    The plugin adds a *\-StartupDBPFLoadTrace:* command line argument that can be used for advanced tracing/debugging of the plugin loading process.


    It supports to following options (only 1 can be used at a time):


    - *ShowLoadTime* \- shows a message box with the resource loading time in milliseconds.

    - *WinAPI* - shows message boxes before and after the resource loading code runs, this allows the user to start and stop a Process Monitor trace when the message box is shown.

    - *ListLoadedFiles* - writes the loaded DBPF files to the plugin's log file in the order SC4 reads them.


    **Troubleshooting**


    The plugin should write a *SC4DBPFLoading.log* file in the same folder as the plugin.


    The log contains status information for the most recent run of the plugin.
