    The SHK Parking Pack is a combination prop and texture pack designed to enable lotters to create varied and distinct parking lots with little or no need for multiple dependencies. This project is
    the result of many months of work with the overall goal of providing everything I could think of to make any configuration of parking area needed.


    There are 3 parts to this download, textures, vehicles and parking props.


    Textures


    Contains a set of 5 asphalt and concrete base textures as well as a few overlays for bridging connections at various points where other textures meet.


    In addition there are 2 files which contain the bulk of the overlays. Two identical sets have been created utilizing both white and yellow space lines, that when used correctly work as a texture
    changer to enable utilizing either all white or all yellow space lines for any lots.


    Vehicle Props


    The largest part of the pack is the vehicle props, starting with 150 single timed and untimed vehicles in both orthogonal and diagonal varieties (300 total). In addition there are a large number
    of orthogonal and diagonal timed clusters (68 total).


    Both the individual vehicles and clusters utilize a special timing system that along with the included prop families enable the creation of ever changing lots with little to no chance of
    repetition.


    * For full details on this system and others within this pack, please refer to the included documentation.


    Parking Props


    A collection of over 100 props to add character and life to your lots, everything from shopping carts to speedbumps.


    *Note - This download contains no lots, it is intended as a dependency for my own and others future lots.
