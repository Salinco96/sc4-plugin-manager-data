    *Welcome to Bradlees!*


    *A little bit like Ames Department Store but with bigger stores located in bigger towns,and a very unique layout. They offered general merchandise with many discounts all year around. They had 130
    stores before they filed for Chapter 11, and then came back with 102 stores in 1997 up to 105 stores in 2000. CEO Peter Thorner cleaned up the financial problems of the company and wanted to see
    Bradlees operating 150 stores. They did opened new stores including one in a former Caldor in Staten Island. Emerging from Chapter 11 in February of 1999, nobody cold have predicted the kind of
    end they announced on December 26th 2000. (Isn't that something, spend all your hard earn cash on christmas and then come back from the holidays and WHAMMO! - no job!)*


    *Bradless store layout was different from Wal-Mart and K-Mart. Wide open, entering the store you could see from one end of the store to the other, not that the store was small, but the ceiling was
    high, asiles not tall, it was simple, and easy to shop.*


    *First Bradlees opened their doors in 1958 in New London, CT. The name "Bradlees" was taken from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, cT where the Company's earliest planning meetngs
    were held. The Stop & Shop Co. acquired the chain in 1961. The Company operated 105 stores in seven (7) Northereastern states: Main, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New
    Jersey, and Pennsylvania.*


    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and
    subsequently upload for yall.

    *February of 1999, New England lost another major regional retail chain of store. Caldor, the company founded by Carl and Dorothy Bennett in 1951, turned to dust. This was the end of the sales
    pitch for the 4th largest retail chain in America. 22,000 workers took home pink slips for their trouble. 145 stores in nine states were put up for lease.*


    *Caldor got it's name from combining the first names of the Bennetts, Carl & Dorothy and opened one small store in Port Chester, New York. The Bennetts sold Caldor to Associated Dry Goods Corp.,
    and in 1986, ADG merged with the May Department Stores Co. In 1991, Caldor went public and grew into a company with 2.5 billion in annual sales. Though in recent years, Caldor failed to distinguish itself from other regional discounters, like Ames Department Stores and could not compete with retail giants like Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target.*


    *This is part of my series of bankrupted department chains that I have created for your Sims to relive which what we had experienced in North America. Ames, Zayre, Woolco, Bradlees, and now Caldor
    all have been swallowed up by the effects of Sam Walton's, Wal-Mart.*


    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and

    Circuit City Stores, Inc. was an American multinational consumer electronics corporation. It was founded in 1949 and pioneered the electronics superstore format in the 1970s. Circuit City
    liquidated its final American retail store in 2009, following a bankruptcy filing and subsequent failure to find a buyer. At the time of liquidation, Circuit City was the second largest U.S.
    electronics retailer, after Best Buy. There were 567 Circuit City Superstores nationwide, ranging in size from 15,000 to 45,000 square feet.


    This beautiful BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot and so this was just sitting around on his hard
    drive. After talking with him, he graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.


    This lot utilizes both the timed props contained in SHK parking pack and seasonal trees. These items may take a day or so to appear.


    For comments/feedback/critique/praise [visit my lot thread](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/64886-nos17-lot-development/) or drop me a pm. I'd be happy to help. Also, visit the

    This small pack contains a handful of miscellaneous B62 props as well as my custom textures and prop families. It serves as a requirement for some of my uploads.


    Anyone may use any of the props, families, or textures on whatever projects you want, but please, refer to this file as a dependency. If you need to edit any of the attributes to fit your project,
    feel free to do do. Credit is not strictly required, but it'd be great if you would do so.


    For comments/feedback/critique/praise or just to see what's coming up next, visit my lot thread ~~over at Simpe~~~~g
    [here](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/68471-plex-on-the-stex-community-support/forum/index.php?topic=11171.0)~~ (may it rest in peace...), or at Simtropolis
