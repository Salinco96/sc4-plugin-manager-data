    This lot utilizes the timed props contained in SHK parking pack. These items may take a day or so to appear.

    Azul's Bistro Bar & Grill is a fictional restaurant, and as far as I know, is not based on any one particular building.


    This beautiful BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot and so this was just sitting around on his hard
    drive. After talking with him, he graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.


    This lot utilizes the timed props contained in SHK parking pack. These items may take a day or so to appear. *I know that the quality of night-lighting on this BAT is unfortunately not the best,
    so I tried to cover it up as much as possible without looking too obvious.*

    BJ's was started by discount department store chain Zayre in 1984. The company's name was derived from the initials of Beverly Jean Weich, the daughter of Mervyn Weich, the president of the new
    company. As of November 6, 2013, BJ's operated 200 BJ's clubs in fifteen states and employed approximately 25,000 team members (both full- and part-time). Its major competitors are Costco
    Wholesale and Walmart's version of a warehouse club concept, Sam's Club. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BJ%27s_Wholesale_Club))

    *Welcome to Bradlees!*


    *A little bit like Ames Department Store but with bigger stores located in bigger towns,and a very unique layout. They offered general merchandise with many discounts all year around. They had 130
    stores before they filed for Chapter 11, and then came back with 102 stores in 1997 up to 105 stores in 2000. CEO Peter Thorner cleaned up the financial problems of the company and wanted to see
    Bradlees operating 150 stores. They did opened new stores including one in a former Caldor in Staten Island. Emerging from Chapter 11 in February of 1999, nobody cold have predicted the kind of
    end they announced on December 26th 2000. (Isn't that something, spend all your hard earn cash on christmas and then come back from the holidays and WHAMMO! - no job!)*


    *Bradless store layout was different from Wal-Mart and K-Mart. Wide open, entering the store you could see from one end of the store to the other, not that the store was small, but the ceiling was
    high, asiles not tall, it was simple, and easy to shop.*


    *First Bradlees opened their doors in 1958 in New London, CT. The name "Bradlees" was taken from Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, cT where the Company's earliest planning meetngs
    were held. The Stop & Shop Co. acquired the chain in 1961. The Company operated 105 stores in seven (7) Northereastern states: Main, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New
    Jersey, and Pennsylvania.*


    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and

    **Recommended**: USL or LRM for parking lot light cones to appear. Users without either will not see anything; no brown box should appear.

    *February of 1999, New England lost another major regional retail chain of store. Caldor, the company founded by Carl and Dorothy Bennett in 1951, turned to dust. This was the end of the sales
    pitch for the 4th largest retail chain in America. 22,000 workers took home pink slips for their trouble. 145 stores in nine states were put up for lease.*


    *Caldor got it's name from combining the first names of the Bennetts, Carl & Dorothy and opened one small store in Port Chester, New York. The Bennetts sold Caldor to Associated Dry Goods Corp.,
    and in 1986, ADG merged with the May Department Stores Co. In 1991, Caldor went public and grew into a company with 2.5 billion in annual sales. Though in recent years, Caldor failed to
    distinguish itself from other regional discounters, like Ames Department Stores and could not compete with retail giants like Wal-Mart, Kmart and Target.*


    *This is part of my series of bankrupted department chains that I have created for your Sims to relive which what we had experienced in North America. Ames, Zayre, Woolco, Bradlees, and now Caldor
    all have been swallowed up by the effects of Sam Walton's, Wal-Mart.*


    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and

    Circuit City Stores, Inc. was an American multinational consumer electronics corporation. It was founded in 1949 and pioneered the electronics superstore format in the 1970s. Circuit City
    liquidated its final American retail store in 2009, following a bankruptcy filing and subsequent failure to find a buyer. At the time of liquidation, Circuit City was the second largest U.S.
    electronics retailer, after Best Buy. There were 567 Circuit City Superstores nationwide, ranging in size from 15,000 to 45,000 square feet.


    This beautiful BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot and so this was just sitting around on his hard
    drive. After talking with him, he graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.


    This lot utilizes both the timed props contained in SHK parking pack and seasonal trees. These items may take a day or so to appear.

    Cub Foods is a supermarket chain with seventy-three stores in Minnesota and Illinois. The company is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eden Prairie, Minnesota-based SuperValu Inc. The store was famous

    Culver Franchising System, Inc. is a privately owned and operated fast casual restaurant chain that operates primarily in the Midwestern United States. The first Culver's opened in 1984 in Sauk
    City, Wisconsin. As of November 5, 2014, the chain had 527 restaurants across the United States delighting guests one meal at a time with their signature ButterBurgers and made-daily Fresh Frozen
    Custard.


    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot and was just sitting around on his hard drive. After talking
    with him, he graciously handed his work over to me to finish and subsequently upload for yall.

    Edit: Perhaps I should comment that the vividly vibrant **blue** you see is beyond my control. I am merely passing along whatever Bobbo662 has already created. And yes, I too think it is a little
    too much... there 'aint nothin I can do. ![9968986.gif](http://nos17.weebly.com/uploads/2/6/0/3/26032074/9968986.gif)

    CVS was originally founded in Lowell, Massachusetts in 1963 and today, it is based in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. CVS is an acronym which stands for "Customer, Value, and Service." CVS now no longer
    builds stores without pharmacies, and many of the "CVS" stores (stores without pharmacies) have been phased out.


    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and
    subsequently upload for yall.

    Kmart is an American chain of discount department stores headquartered in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, United States. The chain purchased Sears for $11 billion in 2005, forming a new corporation
    under the name Sears Holdings Corporation. The company was founded in 1962 and is the third largest discount store chain in the world, behind Walmart and Target. In 2013 it had operated 1,221 in
    49 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, including 1,196 discount stores, averaging 94,000 sq ft (8,700 m2), and 25 Super Centers, averaging 168,000 sq ft (15,600 m2).


    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and

    Thank you [@brad88](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/192946-brad88/) for handing this lot over to me. It was previously missing from what Bobbo662 gave to me.

    Little Caesars is the third largest pizza chain in the United States and is headquartered in Detroit, Michigan. In its early days, the chain built stores where pizza was never served before, such
    as sports arenas, college dormitories, and military bases. Starting in 2004, the chain began offering "Hot-N-Ready" pizzas, where a customer could pick up a large pepperoni pizza for $5 without
    calling in or ordering ahead of time. The concept was successful enough to become a permanent fixture of the chain, and Little Caesars' business model has shifted to focus more on carryout.

    William Zimmerman founded Pic 'N' Save Corporation in 1950 in Culver City, California. By 1985, it operated 90 stores in California and six other Western U.S. states. In 1991, the company changed
    its name to MacFrugals. It later expanded to the Southwest and the South and left both markets in the late 1990s. In 2002, Big Lots bought out the remaining 'MacFrugals' stores for $995 million in
    stock and converted them into the Big Lots brand. ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pic_%27N%27_Save))


    This BAT was originally created by Bobbo662 (aka B62). Unfortunately, due to real life circumstances, he was unable to finish the lot. He graciously handed his work over to me to finish and

    Anyone may use any of the props, families, or textures on whatever projects you want, but please, refer to this file as a dependency. If you need to edit any of the attributes to fit your project,
    feel free to do do. Credit is not strictly required, but it'd be great if you would do so.
