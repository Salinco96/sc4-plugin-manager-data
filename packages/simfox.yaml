    A Prop set of chestnut trees (altogether 8 models) that will be used in my upcoming releases.

    All models are grouped into a family and as such may provide variety for the LOTs.

    These are day only (no special night lighting) so they with some tweaking may be used for mass plantations.

    Enjoy

    This modd alters the look of both Day (slightly) and Night (in far more drastic fashion) view of the game.


    Days gain richer more natural looking shadows, greater overall contrast and better interaction of terrain and various models (in terms of shading).


    Nights are now much darker and less blue/purple. Yet unlike in some other similar modds they aren't completely black-hole, pitch black. The city, vegetation and terrain are all still visible in
    the night, albeit just so.


    *Special Note on TruNite buildings.


    This modd is tailor made to work with DarkNite TruNite buildings. Normal TruNite ones will look overly bright and blue. So look for special DarkNite releases!*


    Have FUN! Questions and suggestions for a time being may be addressed to [BAT4Max thread](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/40623-bat4max-v5)
