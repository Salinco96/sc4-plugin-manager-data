    This modd alters the look of both Day (slightly) and Night (in far more drastic fashion) view of the game.

    Days gain richer more natural looking shadows, greater overall contrast and better interaction of terrain and various models (in terms of shading).

    Nights are now much darker and less blue/purple. Yet unlike in some other similar modds they aren't completely black-hole, pitch black. The city, vegetation and terrain are all still visible in the night, albeit just so.
