  description: >-
    There are some plaza plugins out there on the STEX, even a few modular ones, but with this set, I'm aiming at creating a fully comprehensive modular system of plazas which

      -  have a variety of different functions,
      -  are easy to combine,
      -  and allow adjustment of textures.

    This plugin contains a good number of modular lots that will allow you to create your custom plaza, sidewalk, or seawall. Fountains, ponds, benches, seawalls, market stalls, trees - nearly
    everything is available, I'll leave it to your experimenting pleasure to find out. Most of them are purely decorational (while having park and landmark effect), only the market stalls will yield a
    bit money. All lots have been designed in a way that they are rather simple, thereby being able to be combined with each other easily. All lots can be found in the park menu, just below the
    default Maxis parks.

    By default, all lots will use the standard Maxis white pavement texture, however, I've included some texture override files that will allow you to customize this plugin in a way that all lots will
    change their textures. Mainly included are textures fitting with the PedMall puzzle pieces from the NAM, but since I've seen many users using plugins that override the PedMall textures, I've also
    included a few extra overrides.

    Note: There has been a last-minute change to this plugin that isn't reflected in the screenshots above: I had to remove all the people lurking around on the lots because their immense amount
    looked horrible, and I couldn't find a way to randomize their appearance.

    Please make sure to read the included readme carefully, since you can't just install this plugin and play - due to the texture overrides, you need to customize it first.

    Available languages: English, German

    Dependencies:

    Please refer to the Readme for information about what the dependencies do. Unfortunately, this time you get a good load of dependencies, fortunately, however, most of them are candidates I'm using
    frequently, anyway, or just dependency packages that do nothing except adding props/textures and won't flood you with a lot of lots that will fill your menu quickly. Exception: I've had to use one
    file from the Historic Harbor plugin, which comes with many lots. You only need one file from there (see below).

    Important: If you have downloaded and installed this before June 16th, 2020, please look for the file MPS Textures.dat and remove it. It has become obsolete with the release of the 11241036
    Textures.

    Optional but helpful:

      -  SPOT: https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/24509-spot-simpeg-plop-orientation-tool/
      -  Submenus DLL (for submenu compatibility, please read the rest of this carefully!): https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36142-submenus-dll/

    The following dependencies are required for some of the texture overrides, but the base MPS plugin will entirely work without them:

      -  Vortexture: https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/168-vortext-vortexture-1-2-base-set-grass-and-dirt
      -  MTP Super Pack: https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20966-peg-mtp-super-pack/

    Submenu Compatibility:

    This plugin has been optimized for usage with memo's Submenus DLL plugin. This means that users that are using it will find the MPS lots in their own submenu, which is further divided into 7
    submenus (see below). Users not using the Submenus DLL mod will simply find the MPS lots in the park menu, somewhere in the center. Please read the installation instructions below to avoid
    problems like missing lot icons. The submenu button looks like this (only one out of the four circles is visible at a time):

    Included Files:

    MPS Core Files.dat (mandatory): Contains all lots for the Modular Plaza System, along with their descriptions and icons.

    Seawall Connection Lots.dat (optional): 4 lots that can be used on slopes to connect ground traffic routes to the overpass puzzle pieces from the NAM and thereby blending them in with the seawall
    system you get with this download. You can, of course, as well do this with the NAM's default hillside transition pieces, but they won't fit into the seawalls, visually.

    z_(Name).dat (all optional): A total of 12 additional files that you can choose form that will override your existing MPS lots to give them different base textures. Keep only one of them, or just
    remove them all if you want to play with the base Maxis white pavement texture (see installation instructions below).

    MPS_Submenu Park.dat, MPS_Submenu Plazas.dat (mandatory when using memo's Submenus DLL mod): contains the submenu entry files for the MPS lots. Only use one of these two files.

    Installation:

    Step 1: Please move or copy all existing files (except the Readme files) into the Plugins folder of your edition of SimCity 4.

    Step 2: Choose one texture override. These texture overrides are located one each in all files starting with z_. To apply one, remove all other texture override. To play with the default Maxis
    White Pavement, remove all texture overrides. You may want to look into the folder “Screenshots Texture Overrides“ to find out how they will look in-game. You can at any time switch to another
    texture system by replacing the existing texture override file with another one, in-game, the textures will adapt automatically.

    Step 3: To make the submenu buttons appear correctly, install either the file MPS_Submenu Parks.dat or the file MPS_Submenu Plazas.dat (only one out of these two files). The first file moves the
    MPS submenu simply into the Park menu, the latter one into memo's Plaza submenu.

    Uninstalling: To uninstall this plugin, please bulldoze all MPS lots in your cities and then remove all MPS files from your Plugins folder.

    Compatibility:

    Since this plugin requires installation of the NAM, it is only compatible with SimCity 4: Rush Hour or SimCity 4 Deluxe.

  description: >-
    This dependency package contains a set of textures derived from Maxis, BSC Textures Vol 1 and 2, and Pegasus' MTP for your lotting pleasure. The tables in this archive list all of them along with
    their respective Instance ID's. The graphics should speak for themselves. Some of them are cropped overlay textures, intended to give you more possibilities while creating new lots. The farm field
    textures are derived from Maxis, with two additional textures that have been slightly recolored. There are also new asphalt path (derived from Maxis textures) and gravel path (derived from
    Pegasus) textures (the texture table will be uploaded soon).


    This package also contains a few extra textures which are required for a few of my past uploads. All of them are derived from either NAM or Maxis.


    Files being replaced:


    This dependency package replaces some files I've made some years ago which are obsolete now. If you have downloaded and installed some of my plugins, please search for the files mentioned below
    and remove them:


    MPS Textures.dat: found in Modular Plaza System (MPS)


    TBS_Textures.dat: found in Traffic Blocker Set


    Dependencies:


    This plugin requires no external dependencies.


    Installation:


    Please move or copy all existing files (except the Readme files) into the Plugins folder of your edition of SimCity 4. To uninstall this plugin, remove all files coming with this plugin from your
    Plugins folder.


    Credits:


    I'm hereby giving special credit to those people creating the base textures serving as templates for these overlay textures in the first place:

      -  Maxis: all textures from F85D4005-F85D43AA; all textures from F85C40B0-F85C40CA
      -  The NAM team: F85C405A
      -  All BSC people (unfortunately, I don't know who exactly created these textures): all textures from F85D4405-F85D45AA. SC4D Encyclopedia link: https://wiki.sc4devotion.com/index.php?title=BSC
      -  Pegasus: all textures from F85D4605-F85D47AA

    The uploading has been kindly permitted by @xxdita (in case of the BSC Textures) and @CorinaMarie (on behalf of Pegasus).

    This is a set of car, freight car, and bus traffic blockers for default maxis, SAM, GLR, and RHW routes. They will block one kind of traffic while allowing the other kinds of traffic and
    pedestrians to pass. This may be useful for creating bus lines, simply reducing traffic, preventing cars from taking a shortcut through settlements, keeping freight cars away from residential
    zones and so on. Traffic blockers for roads, one-way roads, avenues, side roads, and railway are already existing on the STEX, but not for SAM and RHW routes, so I thought they might be useful.


    I've tried to keep them as inconspicuous as possible (so not to disrupt the look of your city); therefore the screenshots won't be spectacular. The screenshot below shows a small city where buses
    and pedestrians are taking the SAM 2 Herringbone Street to get to work, while cars are forced to take a detour.


    There are traffic blockers for the subsequently mentioned traffic routes:

      -  Maxis routes: road, street, avenue, one-way road
      -  SAM streets: 2-11
      -  RHW routes: RHW-2, RHW-4, RHW-6, RHW-8, RHW-10, MIS
      -  GLR: Tram-on-Road (only with concrete pavement in the center), Tram-on-Avenue, Tram-on-Street

    For further information, please refer to the readme in the download.

    To be done:

      -  Also, I'd appreciate if someone could explain me how to make Menu Management Lots. Although traffic blockers are sometimes helpful, we probably won't use them everyday, and therefore you may probably want to save space in your game menu.
      -  If I'm getting enough requests, I may include other traffic blockers in later updates.

    Disclaimer:


    Please feel free to develop your own lots using these lot foundations/retaining walls, but if sharing them, please point to this files as a dependency.


    Short description:


    Some lots, when being placed on slopes, will either raise the floor beneath them, or cut into the hill. In the former case, a lot foundation is being created, in the latter, a retaining wall.
    Perhaps it's just me, but I'm quite surprised that I've only found very few plugins with custom foundations and none at all with retaining walls; therefore, I've turned some textures by Maxis or
    other authors (see below for credits) into lot foundations and retaining walls. This plugin therefore acts as a dependency for plugin developers, providing them with the necessary textures and
    exemplar files.


    Dependencies:


    As it is a dependency itself, this plugin has no external dependencies.


    Contained Files:


    LotFoundations.dat: Contains textures and exemplar files for lot foundations. Mandatory.


    RetainingWalls.dat: Contains textures and exemplar files for retaining walls. Mandatory.


    TestLots.dat: This file contains some testing lots that have one texture from both files applied to them, allowing you to test them in-game. These lots do not cost anything and do not have any
    special features. They are at the bottom of the park menu. If you do not want these lots, you can remove this file safely.


    Other than that, this download contains a Readme (unfortunately, due to its size, this time only in English) containing all necessary informations, as well as a tutorial on how to actually switch
    to another fondation/retaining wall and how to use lots if they are supposed to be placed on slopes.


    Credits:


    My special thanks go to all authors that kindly gave me permission to modify and share their work. At the moment, this ist just one person:

      -  Mas71: His set of Japanese hill retaining walls surely is part of the plugins that I'm using most frequently. Now, their functionability is even being expanded.
