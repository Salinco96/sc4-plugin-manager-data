    **Description:**


    This is a small set of community gardens, working as a supplement to the default Maxis community gardens, for those mayors that want their sims to grow their own food. These lots come in 4 sizes,
    from 1x1 to 2x2, and provide a small park effect, as well as a small farming demand cap relief, while charging only low monthly cost.


    For further information and lot statistics, please refer to the Readme.

    **Special notes:**


    **This plugin contains seasonal and semi-seasonal props.** They may not always show up right after plopping. Please let the game run for a few in-game months, and they will appear sooner or later.


    **This plugin has been optimized for usage with memo's Submenus DLL mod.** This means that users who have downloaded this mod will find this plugin being packed into its own submenu (make sure to
    read the installation instructions below). Users who don't use it will simply find it in their park menu, somewhere in the center. The submenu icon looks like this (only one of the 4 circles is
    visible at a time):


    ![Icon_CG_Submenu.thumb.png.ac068eaec43b7f](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/screens/monthly_2024_05/Icon_CG_Submenu.thumb.png.ac068eaec43b7fd77ddfe937d18a241c.png)


    You may want to download memo's Submenus DLL mod here: https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36142-submenus-dll/


    **Installation:**


    Step 1: To install the lots themselves, please put the file Community Gardens.dat into your Plugins folder.


    Step 2 (optional): To allow the submenu button to show up, please either put the file *CG_Submenu Community Gardens.dat* or the file *CG_Submenu Park.dat* into your Plugins folder (do not install
    both files). The first one will make the community garden submenu show up under memo's own Community Gardens submenu, the latter one will simply put it into your Park menu.


    To uninstall this plugin, please remove all instances of this plugin from your cities and then remove all files coming with it.


    **Compatibility:**


    This plugin is only compatible with SC4 Deluxe or SC4 with the Rush Hour Expansion.

    **Description:**


    This plugin contains, as its name already implies, a few plant MMP's derivated from CP's props. Like all other MMP's, they are available in your Mayor Mode menu. There's nothing special to tell
    about them, and there isn't really a coherent theme they all would be part of, but in my opinion they are a nice addition to the game, and they aren't part of any other upload. Some of them are
    seasonal, therefore, please read the item descriptions carefully, because some of these seasonal items need to be planted in in-game September, and some in March.


    **Note about the adapting MMP's:**


    Two of the MMP's are seasonal but come with 4 seasons. Unfortunately, it is not possible yet to make MMP's with 4 rotating seasons (the maximum is 3), thus, I've resorted to a bit of a dirty trick
    there that, as far as I know, hasn't ever been used by anybody yet: Both of these MMP's (the Cherry and the Plum Tree) have been turned into so-called **adapting MMP's**. That means: They will not
    change the look over in-game time, but after plopping them in your cities and saving, you can just replace a file to make them look differently (the graphics will adapt automatically). There are 4
    files per tree, and they have been named accordingly, but please make sure to read the installation instructions below to avoid the double icon bug!


    By the way, the cherry and plum tree additionally come with 3 variants with different season cycles, where I simply left out one of the seasons each. Please read the in-game description to know
    which seasons will be applicable. The flowers also come in both an always flourishing and a seasonal variant. The seasonal variant will be there for 3 months after plopping, and then turn
    invisible.


    **Available languages:** English, German


    **Submenu compatibility:**


    This upload has been optimized for usage with memo's Submenus DLL mod. This means that users who have installed this mod will find all entries located in their own submenu (in the Mayor Mode menu,
    where all other MMP's are). Users who haven't installed it will simply find all entries somewhere in the MMP menu. The submenu icon looks like this:


    ![SubI_CP.thumb.png.950f4701ce6e4bc288fabd](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/screens/monthly_2024_07/SubI_CP.thumb.png.950f4701ce6e4bc288fabdb20c4a9504.png)


    Please also note that due to the number of entries there are **3 further submenus**: Trees - Seasonal Flowers - Evergreen Flowers. All other entries are located in the default CP Floral MMP's
    submenu.


    **Installation:**


    Step 1: Move or copy all files except the Readme into your Plugins folder of SC4.


    Step 2: The folders "Cherry Tree" and "Plum Tree" contain 4 files each, every file with the same entry but with varying graphics. **Only use one of these files per folder!** Remove the 3 others
    from your Plugins folder. To change the season, you can just replace the file you've left there with any of the other files.


    To uninstall, remove all of the MMP's that come with this plugin, and then remove all of its files.


    **Compatibility:**


    This plugin is only compatible with SC4 Deluxe or SC4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack.

    **Description:**


    This mod alters the FA\-2 and FA\-3 roads (only straight routes) that come with NAM to remove the trees (and the lanterns, if you want) there. The idea to do this came to me after reading this
    thread: https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/763344-fractional-angle-w2w/


    Please make sure to read the installation instructions below, the plugin needs to be customized to avoid unwanted effects.


    **Please note:**


    - In unzoned and agricultural areas, no objects show up, anyway. This mod doesn't change this.

    - To make the change reflected in-game close to already grown zones, you may need to plop with the Road tool into a FA\-2 or FA\-3 route.

    - If you are growifying a plopped building with the Growify DLL, the zone changes to low, medium, or high density. This will affect adjacent routes, but only if you drag them again or plop into
    them with the Road tool.

    **Installation:**


    There are 3 files coming with this plugin, **only install one of them**. Please check the screenshots to observe the visual result.


    To install, put one out of these 3 files into your Plugins folder, however, you need to make sure that it loads after NAM or it won't work. To make this sure, create a folder with a name that
    comes later than the NAM folder in alphabet (or just put the entire folder zFA Roads T21 Mod into your Plugins folder).


    What the files do:


    - *FA Roads T21 Mod_Remove All.dat*: removes all objects whatsoever from straight FA\-2 and FA\-3 routes.

    - *FA Roads T21 Mod_Remove Trees all D.dat*: removes all trees whatsoever from straight FA\-2 and FA\-3 routes (the lanters remain).

    - *FA Roads T21 Mod_Remove Trees Lanterns HD.dat*: removes all objects from straight FA\-2 and FA\-3 routes, but only on high-density zoning (residential, commercial, and industrial). Low-density
    zoning (only residential and commercial), as well as the plopped zone, are not affected.


    **Compatibility:**


    This mod is only compatible with SC4: Deluxe or SC4 with Rush Hour installed. Furthermore, **this mod is incompatible with any other mod altering the placement of props via editing the T21
    exemplar files with the same IID the NAM uses.**

    **Description:**


    There are some plaza plugins out there on the STEX, even a few modular ones, but with this set, I'm aiming at creating a fully comprehensive modular system of plazas which


    - have a variety of different functions,

    - are easy to combine,

    - and allow adjustment of textures.


    This plugin contains a good number of modular lots that will allow you to create your custom plaza, sidewalk, or seawall. Fountains, ponds, benches, seawalls, market stalls, trees - nearly
    everything is available, I'll leave it to your experimenting pleasure to find out. Most of them are purely decorational (while having park and landmark effect), only the market stalls will yield a
    bit money. All lots have been designed in a way that they are rather simple, thereby being able to be combined with each other easily. All lots can be found in the park menu, just below the
    default Maxis parks.


    By default, all lots will use the standard Maxis white pavement texture, however, I've included some texture override files that will allow you to customize this plugin in a way that all lots will
    change their textures. Mainly included are textures fitting with the PedMall puzzle pieces from the NAM, but since I've seen many users using plugins that override the PedMall textures, I've also
    included a few extra overrides.


    Note: There has been a last-minute change to this plugin that isn't reflected in the screenshots above: I had to remove all the people lurking around on the lots because their immense amount
    looked horrible, and I couldn't find a way to randomize their appearance.


    Please make sure to read the included readme carefully, since you can't just install this plugin and play - due to the texture overrides, you need to customize it first.


    **Available languages:** English, German


    **Dependencies:**


    Please refer to the Readme for information about what the dependencies do. Unfortunately, this time you get a good load of dependencies, fortunately, however, most of them are candidates I'm using
    frequently, anyway, or just dependency packages that do nothing except adding props/textures and won't flood you with a lot of lots that will fill your menu quickly. Exception: I've had to use one
    file from the Historic Harbor plugin, which comes with many lots. You only need one file from there (see below).


    **Important:** If you have downloaded and installed this before June 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020, please look for the file *MPS Textures.dat* and remove it. It has become obsolete with the release of
    the 11241036 Textures.

    The following dependencies are required for some of the texture overrides, but the base MPS plugin will entirely work without them:


    - **Vortexture:** https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/168-vortext-vortexture-1-2-base-set-grass-and-dirt

    - **MTP Super Pack:** https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20966-peg-mtp-super-pack/


    **Submenu Compatibility:**


    **This plugin has been optimized for usage with memo's Submenus DLL plugin.** This means that users that are using it will find the MPS lots in their own submenu, which is further divided into 7
    submenus (see below). Users not using the Submenus DLL mod will simply find the MPS lots in the park menu, somewhere in the center. Please read the installation instructions below to avoid
    problems like missing lot icons. The submenu button looks like this (only one out of the four circles is visible at a time):


    ![666224d80ace3_2MPS.thumb.png.1106483e888](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/screens/monthly_2024_06/666224d80ace3_2MPS.thumb.png.1106483e88801e2a09412d3345ecee42.png)


    **Included Files:**


    **MPS Core Files.dat** (mandatory): Contains all lots for the Modular Plaza System, along with their descriptions and icons.


    **Seawall Connection Lots.dat** (optional): 4 lots that can be used on slopes to connect ground traffic routes to the overpass puzzle pieces from the NAM and thereby blending them in with the
    seawall system you get with this download. You can, of course, as well do this with the NAM's default hillside transition pieces, but they won't fit into the seawalls, visually.


    **z_(Name).dat** (all optional): A total of 12 additional files that you can choose form that will override your existing MPS lots to give them different base textures. Keep only one of them, or
    just remove them all if you want to play with the base Maxis white pavement texture (see installation instructions below).


    **MPS_Submenu Park.dat, MPS_Submenu Plazas.dat** (mandatory when using memo‘s Submenus DLL mod): contains the submenu entry files for the MPS lots. Only use one of these two files.


    **Installation:**


    **Step 1:** Please move or copy all existing files (except the Readme files) into the Plugins folder of your edition of SimCity 4.


    **Step 2:** Choose one texture override. These texture overrides are located one each in all files starting with z_. To apply one, remove all other texture override. To play with the default Maxis
    White Pavement, remove all texture overrides. You may want to look into the folder “Screenshots Texture Overrides“ to find out how they will look in-game. You can at any time switch to another
    texture system by replacing the existing texture override file with another one, in-game, the textures will adapt automatically.


    **Step 3:** To make the submenu buttons appear correctly, install either the file MPS_Submenu Parks.dat or the file MPS_Submenu Plazas.dat (only one out of these two files). The first file moves
    the MPS submenu simply into the Park menu, the latter one into memo's Plaza submenu.


    **Uninstalling:** To uninstall this plugin, please bulldoze all MPS lots in your cities and then remove all MPS files from your Plugins folder.


    **Compatibility:**


    Since this plugin requires installation of the NAM, it is only compatible with SimCity 4: Rush Hour or SimCity 4 Deluxe.


    **Support:**

  description: >-
    This plugin contains some sets of modular parking lots that can be put together in many ways (your imagination is your limit) to create parking lots. Since there are already some modular systems
    with asphalt textures with white parking lines online, I created sets with gravel and dirt textures instead. Most of these lots allow cars to park on them; however, it is arguable whether this is
    so useful, since, as you may know, one cannot put several transit-enabled lots next to each other because traffic cannot travel between two lots. Currently, there is a total of three sets, sorted
    by texture: Gravel, dark dirt, and light dirt.


    For further information, please refer to the Readme in the download.


    **Note:** There's been a last-minute change which is not reflected in the screenshot. I had to use different car props due to some technical issues with some cars appearing only during the day,
    others only appearing during the night. However, they are mostly placed the same way it looks in the screenshot.


    **Available languages:** English, German


    This plugin has been optimized for usage with Memo's Submenus DLL. This means that users that have downloaded and installed this mod will find all parking lots being placed into their own
    submenus. You will find a PLS submenu containing three lower submenus, each containing one texture set of parking lots. All other users will simply find these lots in the Miscellaneous Transport
    menu. The PLS submenu icon looks like this (not very creative, but it will have to do):

    This plugin contains a row of forest combinations on ploppable lots. These have been designed to fill a certain gap in the game: For filling large areas with trees, there are tree controllers, and
    for creating detailed scenes on a small scale, there are MMP's - however, when trying to place forests on small lots, mostly gaps between buildings, lots, farm fields, or in parks, you can use
    neither nor, because tree controllers are not exact enough, and with MMP's, it will take too long.


    This plugin is supposed to provide a solution: It contains seasonally changing woods that can be placed in such gaps. All lots have a slight park effect, reduce pollution and increase demand for
    residential areas. Furthermore, I've also placed other stuff on these lots that can be found in forests - weeds, ferns, rocks, tree stumps, leaves, berries, and moss. As for the design, I tried to
    find a solution between realism (design it after common forest mixes in central Europe), aesthetics, the trees that are available in the first place (uploaded by Girafe and Orange), and adaption
    to the game (especially to two already available tree controllers).

        This plugin contains 24 lots with seasonally changing woods, based on the seasonally changing trees by girafe. Like other lots, they can be found in the park menu. Plop and demolition cost are
        kept low, and they don't charge monthly costs. They have a low park effect and slightly reduce air and water pollution. I've furthermore tried to create tree combinations corresponding to the
        most common forest combination in central Europe.


        Since I'm using prop families, there shouldn't be any repetitive tree patterns in the trees. There are 3 lot sizes; 1x1 can be used in any small gap in your city, 4x1 can be used for long gaps
        (such as between farm fields) and with the 4x4 lot, you should be able to fill even a large space with trees pretty fast. All lots don't have any base texture and can therefore be combined
        with any terrain mod. They don't trigger the infamous transparent textures bug.


        For further information and more screenshots, please refer to the readme file in the download.


        **Currently available languages:** English, German


        **Credits:**


        **Girafe** for the trees that are making this plugin possible in the first place, and for the permission to duplicate and regroup the props.

    **Short description:**


    This plugin makes SimGoober's Azaleas, Hydrangeas, and Wildflowers that are already featured in many plugins in the internet, available for your Mayor Mode Menu, for your gardening pleasure. For a
    long time, up to still now, they have played an important role in park and garden design. There are, admittedly, more detailed graphics available, but they are still quite useful and versatile and
    fulfill their purpose - this time, even from out of your Mayor Mode Menu, to give you even more freedom in designing your parks and gardens.


    **Please make sure to read the installation instructions to avoid unwanted side effects!**


    For further information, please refer to the Readme in the download.


    Available languages: English, German


    **Dependencies:**


    **BSC Common Dependencies Pack**:
    [https://sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/3-sc4d-LEX\-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack](https://sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/3-sc4d-lex-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack)


    **Installation:**


    Move or copy all files (except the Readme) coming with this plugin into the Plugins folder of your edition of SimCity 4. To uninstall, please remove all azaleas, hydrangeas, and wildflowers that
    have been planted with this plugin, and then remove all files from this plugin.


    **Please only keep one of the two .dat files - they are not compatible, and keeping both may cause unwanted side effects!**


    - *SG Gardening MMP Collection_Combined Entries.dat*: Keep this file to save space in your Mayor Mode Menu. There are only 5 entries; all wildflowers and all blooming azaleas and hydrangeas are
    grouped together to one entry each, and the non-blooming azaleas and hydrangeas get their own entries, each.

    - *SG Gardening MMP Collection_Separate Entries.dat*: Every object gets its own entry. The reason: Since Windows 10, there have been some users affected by a strange bug that, while planting
    MMP's, causes every other item to be skipped, effectively only making half of the entries available. This was the only somewhat feasible solution to this problem.


    **Compatibility:**


    This plugin should be compatible with all editions of SimCity 4. If not, please feel free to tell me.

    **Short description:**


    This dependency package contains a set of textures derived from Maxis, BSC Textures Vol 1 and 2, and Pegasus' MTP for your lotting pleasure. The tables in this archive list all of them along with
    their respective Instance ID's. The graphics should speak for themselves. Some of them are cropped overlay textures, intended to give you more possibilities while creating new lots. The farm field
    textures are derived from Maxis, with two additional textures that have been slightly recolored. There are also new asphalt path (derived from Maxis textures) and gravel path (derived from
    Pegasus) textures (the texture table will be uploaded soon).


    This package also contains a few extra textures which are required for a few of my past uploads. All of them are derived from either NAM or Maxis.


    **Files being replaced:**


    This dependency package replaces some files I've made some years ago which are obsolete now. If you have downloaded and installed some of my plugins, please search for the files mentioned below
    and remove them:


    **MPS Textures.dat:** found in [Modular Plaza System (MPS)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/31351-modular-plaza-system-mps/)


    **TBS_Textures.dat:** found in [Traffic Blocker Set](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28975-traffic-blocker-set/)


    **Dependencies:**


    This plugin requires no external dependencies.


    **Installation:**


    Please move or copy all existing files (except the Readme files) into the Plugins folder of your edition of SimCity 4. To uninstall this plugin, remove all files coming with this plugin from your
    Plugins folder.


    **Credits:**


    I'm hereby giving special credit to those people creating the base textures serving as templates for these overlay textures in the first place:


    - **Maxis:** all textures from F85D4005-F85D43AA; all textures from F85C40B0-F85C40CA

    - **The NAM team:** F85C405A

    - **All BSC people** (unfortunately, I don't know who exactly created these textures): all textures from F85D4405-F85D45AA. SC4D Encyclopedia link: https://wiki.sc4devotion.com/index.php?title=BSC

    - **Pegasus:** all textures from F85D4605-F85D47AA


    The uploading has been kindly permitted by [@xxdita](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/13826-xxdita/) (in case of the BSC Textures) and
    [@CorinaMarie](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/737259-corinamarie/) (on behalf of Pegasus).

    This is a set of car, freight car, and bus traffic blockers for default maxis, SAM, GLR, and RHW routes. They will block one kind of traffic while allowing the other kinds of traffic and
    pedestrians to pass. This may be useful for creating bus lines, simply reducing traffic, preventing cars from taking a shortcut through settlements, keeping freight cars away from residential
    zones and so on. Traffic blockers for roads, one-way roads, avenues, side roads, and railway are already existing on the STEX, but not for SAM and RHW routes, so I thought they might be useful.


    I've tried to keep them as inconspicuous as possible (so not to disrupt the look of your city); therefore the screenshots won't be spectacular. The screenshot below shows a small city where buses
    and pedestrians are taking the SAM 2 Herringbone Street to get to work, while cars are forced to take a detour.


    There are traffic blockers for the subsequently mentioned traffic routes:


    - Maxis routes: road, street, avenue, one-way road

    - SAM streets: 2-11

    - RHW routes: RHW\-2, RHW\-4, RHW\-6, RHW\-8, RHW\-10, MIS

    - GLR: Tram-on-Road (only with concrete pavement in the center), Tram-on-Avenue, Tram-on-Street


    For further information, please refer to the readme in the download.


    **Note:** If you have downloaded this between April 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020, and June 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020, please remove the file TBS_Textures.dat, since it has become obsolete with the release of
    the 11241036 Textures. Please download this dependency package instead.

    **11241036 Textures**


    **SC4Fix: Third-party patches for SC4**


    Not really required, but it resolves that nasty crash-to-desktop bug occurring whenever you hover with a puzzle piece over a transit-enabled lot.


    **Currently available languages:** English, German


    **Installation:**


    Download the archive and extract all files to a folder where you will find them. Move or copy this folder into your Plugins sub-folder of your edition of SimCity 4 (for instance:
    C:/Programs/Maxis/SimCity 4/Plugins).


    To uninstall, please bulldoze all instances of this plugin in your cities, then remove all of its files from your Plugins subfolder.


    **Note, if you have versions prior to version 3 installed:** Please remove it before installing the new plugin. You don't need to bulldoze your already existing traffic stops, and nothing will
    change in-game. However, to tidy up this plugin, I've reorganized the files and packed them into one big file. You'll have them twice if you simply copy this plugin into your plugin folder.


    **Extra note:** For people using my Cobblestone Street Override mod, I've added the extra file *z_TBS SAM 8 Override.dat*, which will alter the base texture to a cobblestone texture. Remove this
    file if you don't want this (see screenshots).


    **Compatibility:**


    Since this plugin requires installation of the Network Addon Mod, it is only compatible with SimCity 4: Rush Hour, or SimCity Deluxe.


    **Credits:**


    - The Network Addon Mod Team for the textures of the routes

    - odrzutowiec for the idea of introducing the GLR traffic blockers


    **Support:**

    **To be done:**


    - Also, I'd appreciate if someone could explain me how to make Menu Management Lots. Although traffic blockers are sometimes helpful, we probably won't use them everyday, and therefore you may
    probably want to save space in your game menu.

    - If I'm getting enough requests, I may include other traffic blockers in later updates.

    **Disclaimer:**


    Please feel free to develop your own lots using these lot foundations/retaining walls, but if sharing them, please point to this files as a dependency.


    **Short description:**


    Some lots, when being placed on slopes, will either raise the floor beneath them, or cut into the hill. In the former case, a lot foundation is being created, in the latter, a retaining wall.
    Perhaps it's just me, but I'm quite surprised that I've only found very few plugins with custom foundations and none at all with retaining walls; therefore, I've turned some textures by Maxis or
    other authors (see below for credits) into lot foundations and retaining walls. This plugin therefore acts as a dependency for plugin developers, providing them with the necessary textures and
    exemplar files.


    **Dependencies:**


    As it is a dependency itself, this plugin has no external dependencies.


    **Contained Files:**


    **LotFoundations.dat:** Contains textures and exemplar files for lot foundations. Mandatory.


    **RetainingWalls.dat:** Contains textures and exemplar files for retaining walls. Mandatory.


    **TestLots.dat:** This file contains some testing lots that have one texture from both files applied to them, allowing you to test them in-game. These lots do not cost anything and do not have any
    special features. They are at the bottom of the park menu. If you do not want these lots, you can remove this file safely.


    Other than that, this download contains a **Readme** (unfortunately, due to its size, this time only in English) containing all necessary informations, as well as a tutorial on how to actually
    switch to another fondation/retaining wall and how to use lots if they are supposed to be placed on slopes.


    **Installation:**


    Move or copy all files in this archive into the Plugins folder of your copy of SimCity 4. To uninstall, just remove these files.


    **Compatibility:**


    This plugin should be compatible with all versions of SimCity 4. If you find out that this is not the case, please tell me.


    **Credits:**


    **My special thanks go to all authors that kindly gave me permission to modify and share their work.** At the moment, this ist just one person:


    - **Mas71:** His set of Japanese hill retaining walls surely is part of the plugins that I'm using most frequently. Now, their functionability is even being expanded.
