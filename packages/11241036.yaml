  description: >-
    There are some plaza plugins out there on the STEX, even a few modular ones, but with this set, I'm aiming at creating a fully comprehensive modular system of plazas which

      -  have a variety of different functions,
      -  are easy to combine,
      -  and allow adjustment of textures.

    This plugin contains a good number of modular lots that will allow you to create your custom plaza, sidewalk, or seawall. Fountains, ponds, benches, seawalls, market stalls, trees - nearly
    everything is available, I'll leave it to your experimenting pleasure to find out. Most of them are purely decorational (while having park and landmark effect), only the market stalls will yield a
    bit money. All lots have been designed in a way that they are rather simple, thereby being able to be combined with each other easily. All lots can be found in the park menu, just below the
    default Maxis parks.

    By default, all lots will use the standard Maxis white pavement texture, however, I've included some texture override files that will allow you to customize this plugin in a way that all lots will
    change their textures. Mainly included are textures fitting with the PedMall puzzle pieces from the NAM, but since I've seen many users using plugins that override the PedMall textures, I've also
    included a few extra overrides.

    Note: There has been a last-minute change to this plugin that isn't reflected in the screenshots above: I had to remove all the people lurking around on the lots because their immense amount
    looked horrible, and I couldn't find a way to randomize their appearance.

    Please make sure to read the included readme carefully, since you can't just install this plugin and play - due to the texture overrides, you need to customize it first.

    Available languages: English, German


    Dependencies:


    Please refer to the Readme for information about what the dependencies do. Unfortunately, this time you get a good load of dependencies, fortunately, however, most of them are candidates I'm using
    frequently, anyway, or just dependency packages that do nothing except adding props/textures and won't flood you with a lot of lots that will fill your menu quickly. Exception: I've had to use one
    file from the Historic Harbor plugin, which comes with many lots. You only need one file from there (see below).


    Important: If you have downloaded and installed this before June 16th, 2020, please look for the file MPS Textures.dat and remove it. It has become obsolete with the release of the 11241036
    Textures.

    Optional but helpful:

      -  Submenus DLL (for submenu compatibility, please read the rest of this carefully!): https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36142-submenus-dll/

    The following dependencies are required for some of the texture overrides, but the base MPS plugin will entirely work without them:

      -  Vortexture: https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/22-dependencies/168-vortext-vortexture-1-2-base-set-grass-and-dirt
      -  MTP Super Pack: https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20966-peg-mtp-super-pack/

    Submenu Compatibility:


    This plugin has been optimized for usage with memo's Submenus DLL plugin. This means that users that are using it will find the MPS lots in their own submenu, which is further divided into 7
    submenus (see below). Users not using the Submenus DLL mod will simply find the MPS lots in the park menu, somewhere in the center. Please read the installation instructions below to avoid
    problems like missing lot icons. The submenu button looks like this (only one out of the four circles is visible at a time):




    Included Files:


    MPS Core Files.dat (mandatory): Contains all lots for the Modular Plaza System, along with their descriptions and icons.

    Seawall Connection Lots.dat (optional): 4 lots that can be used on slopes to connect ground traffic routes to the overpass puzzle pieces from the NAM and thereby blending them in with the seawall
    system you get with this download. You can, of course, as well do this with the NAM's default hillside transition pieces, but they won't fit into the seawalls, visually.

    z_(Name).dat (all optional): A total of 12 additional files that you can choose form that will override your existing MPS lots to give them different base textures. Keep only one of them, or just
    remove them all if you want to play with the base Maxis white pavement texture (see installation instructions below).


    MPS_Submenu Park.dat, MPS_Submenu Plazas.dat (mandatory when using memo's Submenus DLL mod): contains the submenu entry files for the MPS lots. Only use one of these two files.


    Installation:


    Step 1: Please move or copy all existing files (except the Readme files) into the Plugins folder of your edition of SimCity 4.


    Step 2: Choose one texture override. These texture overrides are located one each in all files starting with z_. To apply one, remove all other texture override. To play with the default Maxis
    White Pavement, remove all texture overrides. You may want to look into the folder “Screenshots Texture Overrides“ to find out how they will look in-game. You can at any time switch to another
    texture system by replacing the existing texture override file with another one, in-game, the textures will adapt automatically.


    Step 3: To make the submenu buttons appear correctly, install either the file MPS_Submenu Parks.dat or the file MPS_Submenu Plazas.dat (only one out of these two files). The first file moves the
    MPS submenu simply into the Park menu, the latter one into memo's Plaza submenu.


    Uninstalling: To uninstall this plugin, please bulldoze all MPS lots in your cities and then remove all MPS files from your Plugins folder.


    Compatibility:


    Since this plugin requires installation of the NAM, it is only compatible with SimCity 4: Rush Hour or SimCity 4 Deluxe.
