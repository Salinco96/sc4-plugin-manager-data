    **Warning! Please take yourself time to read the Readme in order to avoid nasty side effects, such as the double icon bug, and some entries not working the way you want.**


    **Dependencies:**


    **BSC Common Dependencies Pack Version 8 or higher:**
    [https://sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/3-sc4d-LEX\-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack](https://sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/3-sc4d-lex-legacy-bsc-common-dependencies-pack)


    *In particular, you need the following files: BSC MEGA Props - CP Vol01.dat, BSC Mega Props - CP Vol02.dat*


    **Seasonal Flora Patch** (if your terrain mod doesn't support seasonal flora):
    https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/25-flora-fauna-and-mayor-mode-ploppables/36-lk33-seasonalflorapatch


    **Submenus DLL** (optional): https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36142-submenus-dll/


    **Other MMP plugins related to CP's content you might be interested in:**


    **BSC CP MMPs for CP MEGA Prop Packs:** https://www.sc4evermore.com/index.php/downloads/download/25-flora-fauna-and-mayor-mode-ploppables/132-bsc-cp-mmp-for-cp-mega-prop-packs


    **Description:**


    This plugin contains, as its name already implies, a few plant MMP's derivated from CP's props. Like all other MMP's, they are available in your Mayor Mode menu. There's nothing special to tell
    about them, and there isn't really a coherent theme they all would be part of, but in my opinion they are a nice addition to the game, and they aren't part of any other upload. Some of them are
    seasonal, therefore, please read the item descriptions carefully, because some of these seasonal items need to be planted in in-game September, and some in March.


    **Note about the adapting MMP's:**


    Two of the MMP's are seasonal but come with 4 seasons. Unfortunately, it is not possible yet to make MMP's with 4 rotating seasons (the maximum is 3), thus, I've resorted to a bit of a dirty trick
    there that, as far as I know, hasn't ever been used by anybody yet: Both of these MMP's (the Cherry and the Plum Tree) have been turned into so-called **adapting MMP's**. That means: They will not
    change the look over in-game time, but after plopping them in your cities and saving, you can just replace a file to make them look differently (the graphics will adapt automatically). There are 4
    files per tree, and they have been named accordingly, but please make sure to read the installation instructions below to avoid the double icon bug!


    By the way, the cherry and plum tree additionally come with 3 variants with different season cycles, where I simply left out one of the seasons each. Please read the in-game description to know
    which seasons will be applicable. The flowers also come in both an always flourishing and a seasonal variant. The seasonal variant will be there for 3 months after plopping, and then turn
    invisible.


    **Available languages:** English, German


    **Submenu compatibility:**


    This upload has been optimized for usage with memo's Submenus DLL mod. This means that users who have installed this mod will find all entries located in their own submenu (in the Mayor Mode menu,
    where all other MMP's are). Users who haven't installed it will simply find all entries somewhere in the MMP menu. The submenu icon looks like this:


    ![SubI_CP.thumb.png.950f4701ce6e4bc288fabd](https://www.simtropolis.com/objects/screens/monthly_2024_07/SubI_CP.thumb.png.950f4701ce6e4bc288fabdb20c4a9504.png)


    Please also note that due to the number of entries there are **3 further submenus**: Trees - Seasonal Flowers - Evergreen Flowers. All other entries are located in the default CP Floral MMP's
    submenu.


    **Compatibility:**


    This plugin is only compatible with SC4 Deluxe or SC4 with the Rush Hour Expansion Pack.

  description: >-
    There are some plaza plugins out there on the STEX, even a few modular ones, but with this set, I'm aiming at creating a fully comprehensive modular system of plazas which


    - have a variety of different functions,

    - are easy to combine,

    - and allow adjustment of textures.


    This plugin contains a good number of modular lots that will allow you to create your custom plaza, sidewalk, or seawall. Fountains, ponds, benches, seawalls, market stalls, trees - nearly
    everything is available, I'll leave it to your experimenting pleasure to find out. Most of them are purely decorational (while having park and landmark effect), only the market stalls will yield a
    bit money. All lots have been designed in a way that they are rather simple, thereby being able to be combined with each other easily. All lots can be found in the park menu, just below the
    default Maxis parks.


    By default, all lots will use the standard Maxis white pavement texture, however, I've included some texture override files that will allow you to customize this plugin in a way that all lots will
    change their textures. Mainly included are textures fitting with the PedMall puzzle pieces from the NAM, but since I've seen many users using plugins that override the PedMall textures, I've also
    included a few extra overrides.


    Note: There has been a last-minute change to this plugin that isn't reflected in the screenshots above: I had to remove all the people lurking around on the lots because their immense amount
    looked horrible, and I couldn't find a way to randomize their appearance.


    Please make sure to read the included readme carefully, since you can't just install this plugin and play - due to the texture overrides, you need to customize it first.


    **Available languages:** English, German


    **Dependencies:**


    Please refer to the Readme for information about what the dependencies do. Unfortunately, this time you get a good load of dependencies, fortunately, however, most of them are candidates I'm using
    frequently, anyway, or just dependency packages that do nothing except adding props/textures and won't flood you with a lot of lots that will fill your menu quickly. Exception: I've had to use one
    file from the Historic Harbor plugin, which comes with many lots. You only need one file from there (see below).

    - **Submenus DLL** (for submenu compatibility, **please read the rest of this carefully!**): https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/36142-submenus-dll/


    The following dependencies are required for some of the texture overrides, but the base MPS plugin will entirely work without them:

    - **MTP Super Pack:** https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/20966-peg-mtp-super-pack/


    **Submenu Compatibility:**


    **This plugin has been optimized for usage with memo's Submenus DLL plugin.** This means that users that are using it will find the MPS lots in their own submenu, which is further divided into 7
    submenus (see below). Users not using the Submenus DLL mod will simply find the MPS lots in the park menu, somewhere in the center. Please read the installation instructions below to avoid
    problems like missing lot icons. The submenu button looks like this (only one out of the four circles is visible at a time):

    **Compatibility:**


    Since this plugin requires installation of the NAM, it is only compatible with SimCity 4: Rush Hour or SimCity 4 Deluxe.

11241036/textures:
  authors:

  category: 110
  description: >-
    This dependency package contains a set of textures derived from Maxis, BSC Textures Vol 1 and 2, and Pegasus' MTP for your lotting pleasure. The tables in this archive list all of them along with
    their respective Instance ID's. The graphics should speak for themselves. Some of them are cropped overlay textures, intended to give you more possibilities while creating new lots. The farm field
    textures are derived from Maxis, with two additional textures that have been slightly recolored. There are also new asphalt path (derived from Maxis textures) and gravel path (derived from
    Pegasus) textures (the texture table will be uploaded soon).


    This package also contains a few extra textures which are required for a few of my past uploads. All of them are derived from either NAM or Maxis.


    **Files being replaced:**


    This dependency package replaces some files I've made some years ago which are obsolete now. If you have downloaded and installed some of my plugins, please search for the files mentioned below
    and remove them:


    **MPS Textures.dat:** found in [Modular Plaza System (MPS)](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/31351-modular-plaza-system-mps/)


    **TBS_Textures.dat:** found in [Traffic Blocker Set](https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/28975-traffic-blocker-set/)


    **Dependencies:**


    This plugin requires no external dependencies.


    **Installation:**


    Please move or copy all existing files (except the Readme files) into the Plugins folder of your edition of SimCity 4. To uninstall this plugin, remove all files coming with this plugin from your
    Plugins folder.


    **Credits:**


    I'm hereby giving special credit to those people creating the base textures serving as templates for these overlay textures in the first place:


    - **Maxis:** all textures from F85D4005-F85D43AA; all textures from F85C40B0-F85C40CA

    - **The NAM team:** F85C405A

    - **All BSC people** (unfortunately, I don't know who exactly created these textures): all textures from F85D4405-F85D45AA. SC4D Encyclopedia link: https://wiki.sc4devotion.com/index.php?title=BSC

    - **Pegasus:** all textures from F85D4605-F85D47AA


    The uploading has been kindly permitted by [@xxdita](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/13826-xxdita/) (in case of the BSC Textures) and
    [@CorinaMarie](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/737259-corinamarie/) (on behalf of Pegasus).

    This is a set of car, freight car, and bus traffic blockers for default maxis, SAM, GLR, and RHW routes. They will block one kind of traffic while allowing the other kinds of traffic and
    pedestrians to pass. This may be useful for creating bus lines, simply reducing traffic, preventing cars from taking a shortcut through settlements, keeping freight cars away from residential
    zones and so on. Traffic blockers for roads, one-way roads, avenues, side roads, and railway are already existing on the STEX, but not for SAM and RHW routes, so I thought they might be useful.


    I've tried to keep them as inconspicuous as possible (so not to disrupt the look of your city); therefore the screenshots won't be spectacular. The screenshot below shows a small city where buses
    and pedestrians are taking the SAM 2 Herringbone Street to get to work, while cars are forced to take a detour.


    There are traffic blockers for the subsequently mentioned traffic routes:


    - Maxis routes: road, street, avenue, one-way road

    - SAM streets: 2-11

    - RHW routes: RHW\-2, RHW\-4, RHW\-6, RHW\-8, RHW\-10, MIS

    - GLR: Tram-on-Road (only with concrete pavement in the center), Tram-on-Avenue, Tram-on-Street


    For further information, please refer to the readme in the download.


    **Note:** If you have downloaded this between April 15<sup>th</sup>, 2020, and June 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020, please remove the file TBS_Textures.dat, since it has become obsolete with the release of
    the 11241036 Textures. Please download this dependency package instead.

    **11241036 Textures**


    **SC4Fix: Third-party patches for SC4**


    Not really required, but it resolves that nasty crash-to-desktop bug occurring whenever you hover with a puzzle piece over a transit-enabled lot.


    **Currently available languages:** English, German


    **Extra note:** For people using my Cobblestone Street Override mod, I've added the extra file *z_TBS SAM 8 Override.dat*, which will alter the base texture to a cobblestone texture. Remove this
    file if you don't want this (see screenshots).


    **Compatibility:**


    Since this plugin requires installation of the Network Addon Mod, it is only compatible with SimCity 4: Rush Hour, or SimCity Deluxe.


    **Credits:**


    - The Network Addon Mod Team for the textures of the routes

    - odrzutowiec for the idea of introducing the GLR traffic blockers

11241036/various-lot-foundations-and-retaining-walls:
  authors:
    - "11241036"
  category: 100
  description: >-
    Some lots, when being placed on slopes, will either raise the floor beneath them, or cut into the hill. In the former case, a lot foundation is being created, in the latter, a retaining wall.
    Perhaps it's just me, but I'm quite surprised that I've only found very few plugins with custom foundations and none at all with retaining walls; therefore, I've turned some textures by Maxis or
    other authors (see below for credits) into lot foundations and retaining walls. This plugin therefore acts as a dependency for plugin developers, providing them with the necessary textures and
    exemplar files.


    **Information to LOTers:**


    Please feel free to develop your own lots using these lot foundations/retaining walls, but if sharing them, please point to this files as a dependency.



    **Dependencies:**


    As it is a dependency itself, this plugin has no external dependencies.


    **Contained Files:**


    **LotFoundations.dat:** Contains textures and exemplar files for lot foundations. Mandatory.


    **RetainingWalls.dat:** Contains textures and exemplar files for retaining walls. Mandatory.


    **TestLots.dat:** This file contains some testing lots that have one texture from both files applied to them, allowing you to test them in-game. These lots do not cost anything and do not have any
    special features. They are at the bottom of the park menu. If you do not want these lots, you can remove this file safely.


    Other than that, this download contains a **Readme** (unfortunately, due to its size, this time only in English) containing all necessary informations, as well as a tutorial on how to actually
    switch to another fondation/retaining wall and how to use lots if they are supposed to be placed on slopes.


    **Compatibility:**


    This plugin should be compatible with all versions of SimCity 4. If you find out that this is not the case, please tell me.


    **Credits:**


    **My special thanks go to all authors that kindly gave me permission to modify and share their work.** At the moment, this ist just one person:


    - **Mas71:** His set of Japanese hill retaining walls surely is part of the plugins that I'm using most frequently. Now, their functionability is even being expanded.
