    **Commissioned 1913**


    **24,988 tons - 200.6 m (658 foot) length - 28.5 m (93 foot) beam - 9.3m (30 foot) draft - 27 knots - complement: 43 officers and 1,025 men - 10x28 cm (11-in) guns - 12x15 cm (5,9-in) guns -
    12x8.8 (3.5-in) guns - 4x50cm (19.7-in) torpedo tubes - belt armour up to 300mm (11.8 in).**


    *SMS Seydlitz* was widely regarded as a “lucky” ship - and went down in history as “the ship too tough to die”. She was a product of the political struggle within the Imperial Navy - from Kaiser
    Wilhelm II down to the serving line officers. Großadmiral von Tirpitz wanted battlecruisers to fight other cruisers. The Kaiser, and many of the line officers, knew the Hochseeflotte would be
    outnumbered by the Royal Navy - and they wanted the battlecruisers to be strong enough to take their place in the line of battle when required. And - there was the pinch-penny Reichstag to be
    considered. Consequently, *Seydlitz* was a compromise in design - but a step in the right direction. Very much similar to the previous *Moltke Class*, the new battlecruiser had a redesigned and
    improved machinery plant, a greater displacement than the *Moltke Class*, and a much improved and increased armour scheme. She is often considered a “Third Generation” German battlecruiser.


    Much favoured by Vizeadmiral Hipper, she served as flagship Scouting Forces from June 1914 to October 1917, and fought in every major engagement in the North Sea as well as several in the Baltic
    Sea. At the Battle of Jutland, *Seydlitz* shared credit with *SMS Derfflinger* in the sinking of the British battlecruiser *HMS Queen Mary*. In the same battle, she suffered hits from some 21
    large caliber shells, and in an epic struggle against the odds, narrowly made it back to port - becoming “the ship too tough to die”. *Seydlitz* survived the war - only to be scuttled by her crew
    in 1919 at Scapa Flow.

    “Life in the Navy is mighty fine…” or so the song goes. But life in the Edwardian Era navy - British or German - was not exactly a walk in the park. The North Sea, known as one of Earth's smaller
    seas, can be a surprisingly inhospitable place. Cold on those long night watches - even in summer - and cold enough in winter to freeze the spray coming over the bow. Capital ship crews ranged
    from 900 to 1,200 officers and men, and even these big ships could be quite cramped below decks. The Royal Navy frequently slung hammocks on three levels, while the Germans managed to keep them on
    two tiers. Officers, of course, had cabins - though they often shared. Messing arrangements for the rank and file were not much better. Usually, communal tables were suspended from the deckhead
    and lowered on ropes at meal time (like a large swing), while the food was brought from a central galley. The food was not always good, but it was filling. The Royal Navy had better food, mainly
    because their supply system was effective. In Germany, as the war went on, the home front was unable to provide adequate supplies for the Army or the Navy. Where dining and sleeping arrangements
    were concerned, both navies were segregated by rank and social class. While the enlisted men came from all walks of life, the officers tended to be drawn from the nobility, or at least, the very
    rich.


    In SC4, you can build the breakwaters, the piers, quays, and docks, and even plop the giant cranes to service your fleet of warships. But to really bring your naval base to life - you MUST have a
    dockyard workforce and SAILORS. “AP” has crafted an entire range of sailors, patterned after the uniforms of the Kaiserliche Marine. Tall leather seaboots, black trousers, and white jumpers with
    the black “tar-flap” neckerchief tied in a square knot across the chest. Topping it off is the traditional round, “flat-hat”, with a ribbon around the base carrying the ship's name, tied at the
    back with the ends dangling down the neck. Of course, both the Royal Navy and the Kaiserliche Marine had summer uniforms - often referred to as “whites”. Dockyard quays are busy places. And
    everywhere you look, there are swarms of sailors and dock workers - going about a thousand different tasks. “AP” has provided a wide variety of figures and poses that can be suited to any job.
    This is the first installment of sailors - to be followed by other figures that will bring your dockside scenes to life.

    It is fair to say any navy is only as good as their ships - and the men that sail them. And it is equally true to say a navy is only as good as the men that lead it. A small, but efficient navy
    can go on to victory - while a large, but poorly led navy can go down in defeat. That is, of course, a rather “broad” statement - but the Royal Navy and the Kaiserliche Marine were no exception to
    this dictum. And the crews in both navies were obvious products of the society in which they existed.


    The Royal Navy of the late Victorian and Edwardian Era was an institution undergoing enormous technological changes at the same time science was forcing social changes as well. It must be
    remembered the crew of a large capital ship was, quite literally, a microcosm of the society that created it. While the Royal Navy officer corps was largely composed of the well-to-do and minor
    nobility (the snobbish “public schools” - Eaton and Harrow, etc,) -- it was not uncommon to find a ship's captain and even more senior officers ennobled as Dukes, Earls, or Barons. But the coming
    of technology forced an ever increasing rise in the importance of the “engineer” officer. This gradually forced the upper ranks in the navy to include the “below decks” officers in their social
    groupings. This transformation also applied to “specialist officers” - schooled experts in gunnery, wireless communications, and torpedoes.


    The Kaiserliche Marine of the Wilhelmine Era (approximately 1880 - 1918) was also undergoing many of the scientific changes brought on by steam power and big guns. But the Germans embraced the
    advance of technology as a means to an end, rather than a social shift. If possible, Wilhelmine society was even more rigid and class structured than the British. It was quite common to find even
    a torpedo boat captain with the noble “von” attached to his name. The German (Prussian) class structure was deeply ingrained in the officer corps, but their logical approach to shipboard life
    allowed them to tightly integrate the engineering and specialist officers while strictly maintaining their social status divisions. This approach worked well up until 1918, when the old social
    order collapsed.


    But there is one thing certain - wherever you find a large body of enlisted men (Army or Navy) - you will find an officer keeping a watchful eye to make sure they are on the job and not sitting on
    their “duff”. “AP” has created a small Officer Prop Pack to make sure your “Sim-sailors” are properly supervised.

    This may not sound like a very “professional” name for this prop pack, but it is most accurate. Docks, piers, and quays, though commonly found in harbours and naval anchorages, were surprisingly
    expensive to build and there never seemed to be enough of them. Consequently, they were always busy places - with ships coming and going - loading and unloading cargo - taking on provisions or
    ammunition -- or berthing ships while repairs were made or new equipment was installed. As a result of all this activity, docks and quaysides were crowded and littered with a wide variety of
    “clutter”.


    “AP” has provided us with a small assortment of props which were carefully chosen to add detail and authenticity to your docks and piers. This selection has been modelled to the scale of the
    sailors and dock workers to avoid the props already in the game which are often too large for the scene. The rusty anchors and anchor chains are perfect for any pier, or even a salvage yard. And
    the piles of planks covered by worn canvas tarps are perfect accessories to any dock - as are the perennial rope coils. One item, the refuelling points, are especially useful and quite well done.
    For those of you that are into Naval ceremony and lore, “AP” has included a ship's ceremonial “Kisbee” and “presence board” for dockside display. (The “kisbee” is explained in Chapter 11.)

    This is the third ammunition prop pack in the series (so far) and it deals with ammunition carried in lighters. At the turn of the last century, ammunition could have been shipped into your naval
    base by one of two methods -- via the railroad, or by sea. Most German naval bases on the North Sea were surrounded by shallow water and could only be reached by dredged deep-water channels, so
    large cargo steamers were rarely used. And though the Imperial German Army had first call on rail priorities, the navy preferred to rely upon coastal shipping. Tugboats pulling lighters loaded
    with cargo were ideally suited to working the inshore shallows. “AP” has provided you with a variety of lighters loaded with ammunition and powder for the guns of the fleet.

    After the cruise of the Great White Fleet (1907 to 1909), the United States Navy understood it would be impossible to rely upon foreign or commercially leased colliers during wartime conditions.
    Congress had always been reluctant to appropriate funds to build colliers due to their belief the fleet was meant to defend American shores - not to go swanning about on overseas duties. But the
    Navy was persistent, and between 1913 and 1917, four *Proteus Class* (sometimes referred to as *Jupiter Class*) colliers were designed and built. They were state-of-the-art for their day and could
    handle two ships (one on either beam) with a streamlined system of booms and winches for maximum speed and efficiency. Their length and narrow beam, with the forest of “Kingston posts” and cargo
    booms, made them unique among colliers. *USS Jupiter* was converted into the experimental aircraft carrier *USS Langley* in 1920, and was lost to Japanese air attack off Java in 1942. *USS
    Cyclops* was lost without a trace in 1918 -- both *USS Proteus* and *Nereus* were lost in 1941 - also without a trace. And all three were lost on the same shipping lane -- in the vicinity of the
    Bermuda Triangle.

    ***USS Vestal - 1908***


    **12,585 tons - 142m (465 ft) length - 18.3m (60 ft) beam - 7.9m (26 ft) draft - 16 knots -4x76.2mm (3-in) guns -- compliment: 35 officers and 748 enlisted.**


    The *USS Vestal* was commissioned into service in 1908 as a fleet collier (*Prometheus Class*), but was taken out of service in 1912, overhauled, converted, and recommissioned in 1913 as a fleet
    repair ship. Many navies had various auxiliary support ships lying about their harbours - accommodation ships, depot ships for destroyers, colliers, depot ships for submarines - and usually one or
    more repair ships of various types. The United States, unlike Great Britain, did not have numerous colonial ports and coaling stations where repair facilities would be available, and the problem
    was particularly troubling in the vast reaches of the Pacific. Since repairs could not be preformed in Guam or the Philippines, a fleet would have to be maintained on the voyage out, while
    operating in the area, and on the return voyage to the West Coast. Consequently, the US Navy practically invented the concept of “Fleet Trains”. Like supply trains for a marching army, the Fleet
    Trains would sail with the warships and carry supplies, ammunition, fuel, and the necessary repair facilities across the wide Pacific. Vestal was capable of preforming blacksmith work, boiler
    repair, carpentry, coppersmithing, electrical work, foundry work, pipe-fitting, plating and sheet metal work, welding, and repair of optical instruments and mechanical components.


    *Vestal* was anchored astern of the *USS Arizona* on 7 December 1941. She was damaged, but survived the war years to anchor among the battle fleet for Japan's surrender in Tokyo Bay in 1945. Along
    the way, she earned two Battle Stars for action against the enemy. After 38 years of active sea service, *Vestal* was stricken from the Naval Register in 1946 and sold for scrap in 1950.

    **How to use**


    This pack contains .SC4model-files and props as .SC4desc-files. So, by installing this pack nothing will directly appear in your game. You can use the props on your own lots or convert the
    SC4models into buildings, as you please. Since most props are to be used on water lots and props naturally align with the surface level, they will sink to the sea floor, if you do not stick to the
    guidelines on how to use [props on water lots](https://community.simtropolis.com/omnibus/simcity-4/bat-lot-editor-tutorials/tutorial-for-props-on-water-r852/). Finally you will need to follow the
    [instructions on how to make a lot transparent](https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/37597-sc4dot-sign-shop/?do=findComment&comment=1030546). You will find the props in any Lot-Editor
    under the prefix **A_1P_h_**


    **As per request from the community, I have also included a version of the ship without historic flags and crew.**


    **Please visit [@Dreadnought](https://community.simtropolis.com/profile/683435-dreadnought/)'s CJ to get detailed descriptions and the historical backgrounds to these prop packs. You will see a
    wonderful display of the results of our long collaboration there and can get a preview of what might be hidden in the coming prop packs or simply get some inspiration for your own harbour!**

    In the days of Nelson's ships-of-the-line, provisions and ship's stores were crammed into every nook and cranny of the big three-deckers. The old sailing battleships might well be at sea for
    months on end and a crew of up to 900 men had to be fed and provided with water, beer, and rum. Unfortunately for the sailors, victualling a warship in those days was a truly primitive business.
    As far as food, almost everything was packed into wooden barrels and the lids sealed with tar. Pork and beef were salted and cured. The fresh water and spirits were simply sealed in barrels. And
    since baking bread was too hazardous on wooden sailing ships, a flour-based cracker was substituted - appropriately referred to as “Hardtack”. Eventually, improperly seasoned wooden barrels would
    open at the seams, the contents would begin to spoil, and the already bad food got even worse. Fresh vegetables, however, were never available for more than a week or two once the vessel had
    sailed, so lime juice was shipped to help prevent scurvy and other diseases caused by vitamin deficiency. Circumstances were much improved by the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century and dreadnought
    warships equipped with refrigeration systems made frequent port calls to replenish fresh food supplies.


    “AP” has provided us with a prop pack of finely detailed and textured provisions to be loaded aboard your ships from the docks. They come in a variety of cases, boxes, and crates in a wide range
    of colours that could represent apples, potatoes, beans, cheese, boxed meats, etc, etc. And he has thoughtfully provided a selection of sailors to help move them around. These could also be used
    around trucking terminals, for truck deliveries to supermarkets, or to unload from trains into your warehouses.
